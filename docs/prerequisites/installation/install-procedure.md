## Customize Installation

In the __Customize__ screen you can see each separate component, which the installer wizard can add to the Test Studio installation:

- Visual Studio Plugin for the compatible Visual Studio installations on the computer, 
- Sample project folder,
- Testing Framework Samples and Templates,
- Telerik Controls Translators and

Any of these can be removed or added in the __Customize__ screen. You are also allowed to change the default installation path. After making your selections, click the __'OK'__ button to continue.

There are a few important notes to consider if you select some of the below components:

- If you have __Visual Studio__ Professional or higher installation on the machine, Test Studio plugin for Visual Studio will be automatically selected for installation.
- To use this machine as a __Storage or Scheduling Server__ in a Test Studio Scheduling setup, you must select the respective components to install the Test Studio services during initial installation or when changing the existing.
- To add the __Storage, Scheduling and Executive Dashboard features__ at a later stage, <a href="/getting-started/installation/add-services" target="_blank">you must change the existing installation</a> and select the respective components in the __Customize__ screen.
- Storage service uses <a href="https://www.mongodb.com" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> as storage database and this gets automatically installed, if not available on the machine. __MongoDB requires at least 4Gb free hard drive space__ to operate normally.
