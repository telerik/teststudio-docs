# The ArtOfTest.WebAii.Silverlight.UI Namespace

The UI namespace includes all the strongly-typed controls like **Button**, **DataGrid**, **TextBox**, etc. and their properties/methods and enum's, mirroring as much as possible the set of controls available in Silverlight as documented <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.frameworkelement(VS.96).aspx" target="_blank">here</a>. The namespace also includes the types used by these properties like **Brush**, **SolidBrush**, etc.
 
The getting of simple primitive and complex properties is supported but only the setting of simple primitive properties and enum's and a few complex properties is also supported.
