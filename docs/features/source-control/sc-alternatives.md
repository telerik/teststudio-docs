# Alternative File-Based Source Control Systems

Alternative File-Based Source Control Systems

Test Studio can interact with any file-based source control system. Since Test Studio integrates directly with <a href="/features/source-control/tfs/overview-tfs" target="_blank">Team Foundation Server</a> and  <a href="/features/source-control/git/overview-git" target="_blank">Git</a>, you will need to use a third party tool to check files in and out. Test Studio regards the projects as local, since files are not checked in and out within Test Studio.

Popular examples include:

- <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/" target="_blank">Subversion (SVN)</a>
- <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_blank">Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</a>

See our <a href="/features/source-control/checkin-guidelines" target="_blank">check-in guidelines</a> to identify the proper files for check-in.
