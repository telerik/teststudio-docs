## Enable Quality Center in Test Studio 2020 R3 SP Release

The button to connect a Test Studio project to a __Quality Center__ solution is __removed in Test Studio release R3 SP 2020 (v.2020.3.1209)__. You still can bring up the button back in the product.

Open a File Explorer and navigate to the Test Studio installation _Bin_ sub-folder (the default location is _C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Test Studio\Bin_). Locate the _Telerik.TestStudio.exe.config_ file and modify it as follows:

1. Open the file with a text editor (like Notepad++).
1. In the _appSettings_ section add a key _ShowQCPlugin_ and set its value to true. See example below.

````
<appSettings>
	<add key="CommandLineRun" value="True" />
	<add key="PersistOnEachStep" value="False" />
	<add key="ShowQCPlugin" value="False" />
</appSettings>
````

1. Restart Test Studio and the QC button will be back in the _Project Ribbon_.
