# How to Submit a Bug to Jira with Required Custom Field

The current Test Studio implementation for JIRA bug tracking does not support specifying custom fields through the UI when submitting a bug. Thus you will get the following error when try to submit the bug directly:

![Jira Error][1]

In order to denote your required fields and what to fill them with, create a file called **JiraMappings.json** in the following directory: **C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Test Studio\Bin\Plugins**

![Plugins Folder][2]



Open it with a text editor, like Notepad, and insert the following content:

````JSON
{
"IssueTypeName": "Defect",
"Fields" : {"assignee": {"name": "username" }, "labels": ["defect"],Â  "customfield_10401":{"required custom field": "value"}, "customfield_10402":{"another required custom field": "value"} }
}
````

In JIRA, custom fields are referenced by "customfield_" + the id of the custom field. In the above example there are two custom fields referrenced with their names and respective values. 

> When configuring the default values for your custom fields in the json file, you should have in mind the type of the field and use the correct id and syntax.
