# Element Steps Tab

The __Advanced Recording Tools__ window allows you to build various steps specific for a given element. You can manually select an element from the <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/dom-explorer" target="_blank">DOM Explorer tab</a> or use the <a href="/features/recorder/highlighting-menu/element-options" target="_blank">highlighting menu to bring up the step options for an element</a>.

Find out more about adding element steps below.

## Choose an Element to Build Step

If there is no element selected in the __DOM Explorer__, the __Element Steps__ remains empty.

![Select Element from DOM][1]

Choose an element from the DOM Explorer, or use the highlighting menu to locate an element in the DOM. The __Elements Steps__ tab shows the __Actions__ and __Verifications__ options relative for the selected element. Choose a step and click the **Add Step** button to add it into the test.

## Actions

![Actions][3]

The __Actions__ section gives you the option to add different type of actions for an element - mouse clicks and actions, scrolling and JavaScript events. 

> __Tip__
> 
> The default mouse click steps and scrolling options can be added directly through the <a href="/automated-tests/recording/hover-over-highlighting#options-in-the-highlighting-menu" target="_blank">highlighting menu</a>. 

- __Mouse Actions__ are invoked as if the real user was directly using the mouse. They range from different Left and Right mouse button actions, for which you could <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/actions/adv-mouse-actions" target="_blank">specifying where to send the click</a>, to <a href="/features/recorder/highlighting-menu/mouse-actions" target="_blank">hover over</a> and <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/actions/drag-and-drop" target="_blank">drag&drop actions</a> to help covering all scenarios.

- <a href="/features/recorder/highlighting-menu/scroll-actions" target="_blank">__Scroll Actions__</a> are used to ensure that the element is visible on the screen. You can scroll the element to three different positions - top, bottom and center of the page.

- <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/actions/javascript-events" target="_blank">__JavaScript Events__</a> are used to manually invoke an event against the highlighted element.

## Verifications

![Verifications][4]

Once you have added the necessary actions, you still have to verify that those actions lead to a successful result and everything happened as expected. There are several ways to verify elements in Test Studio:

- <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/quick-verification" target="_blank">Quick Verification</a> - create an easy verification from the Quick Tasks menu.

- <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/advanced-verification" target="_blank">Advanced Verification</a> - craft a custom verification from the Sentence Verification Builder.

- <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/wait" target="_blank">Wait</a> - does not continue until the comparison is true.

- <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/extraction" target="_blank">Extraction</a> - extract an element's value and reuse it later in your test.

- <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/image-verification" target="_blank">Image Verification</a> - this feature is based on an elementâ€™s visual rendering rather than the properties or attributes of that element.

- <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/text-from-image" target="_blank">Text from Image</a> - this feature checks the text from an image and compares it to the expected value.

Verifications in Test Studio allow you to:

- Measure against multiple criteria at one time.
- Build these measurements in an interactive manner without code.
- Detect if elements are in a particular state (e.g. is visible, exists).
- Detect if attributes and properties compare with specific values.
- Verify content, attributes, images, image texts, styles, visibility, drop-down list selections, checkboxes, radio buttons, tables and property values.

Test Studio implements verification through "sentences" that compare a portion of an element to a value, such as:

- textbox content is equal to 'order 2011'
- image path contains 'http://www.telerik.com'
- wait for element to exist

> Test Studio cannot read and verify against the contents of a PDF file loaded in the browser, as it does not have a DOM structure like a traditional web page. If you can store that information in a file type such as XLS, XML, CSV, or a SQL database, then you can use the <a href="/features/data-driven-testing/Overview" target="blank">Data Driving</a> feature.
