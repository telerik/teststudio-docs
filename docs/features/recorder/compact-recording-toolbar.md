# Compact Recording Toolbar

The **Compact Recording Toolbar** is designed to maximize functionality and minimize the space on your screen. You can position it freely anywhere in the browser or WPF application, so it does not cover any elements from the application under test. We will go into more details about each of the buttons and features that the **Compact Recording Toolbar** has.

## Hover Over Highlighting ##

![Enable Highlighting Button][2]

Enable/Disable Hover Over Highlighting from the **Compact Recording Toolbar**. When the mouse pauses over a highlighted element in the recording surface, you will see the context menu with multiple options. This rich menu makes it easy to work with the recording surface and its elements. It provides quick access to relevant functions right in the page or application you are testing.
