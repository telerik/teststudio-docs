# Compact Recording Toolbar

The **Compact Recording Toolbar** minimizes the space used from Test Studio on your screen and keeps the application under test on focus. Along with that you can access the most used recording functionalities directly from the toolbar. The recorder can be easily re-positioned anywhere in the tested application, so it doesn't cover any of its elements.

The following article describes the functionalities of the **Compact Recording Toolbar**
