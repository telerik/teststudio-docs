# Verification Steps

Verification steps in Test Studio allow you to design your automation tests in a stable and reliable manner. With the right verification step you can ensure the state of the application at each action.

Find out more about verification steps and how to record these in the below article.

## General Notes

While recording the automated test scenarios you visually validate that each of your actions is accepted and processed from the tested application. The __verification steps let you create any sort of checks for an element__. That way you can ensure what is the state of that element during the test run and if it is what you expect before and after performing an action against it.

> Take a look <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/make-your-automated-tests-see-better-than-yourself" target="_blank">at this blog post about using verification and wait steps</a> in the automation tests.

The verification steps in Test Studio allows you to:

- Use multiple checks against different criteria at one time.
- Build these checks out-of-the-box in an interactive manner during recording the test scenarios without using code.
- Detect if elements are in a particular state (e.g. is visible, exists).
- Detect if attributes and properties compare with specific values.
- Verify content, attributes, images, image texts, styles, visibility, drop-down list selections, checkboxes, radio buttons, tables and etc.

Test Studio implements verification through "sentences" that compare a portion of an element to a value, such as:

- textbox content is equal to 'order 2011'
- image path contains 'http://www.telerik.com'
- wait for element to exist

> **Note**
>
> The engine for creating the verification sentences allows you to __convert any Verification step to Wait or Extraction step (converting to extraction step is available for text based verification)__. Use the _Change Role_ option from the <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-step-context-menu" target="_blank">step context menu</a> and choose from the options in the sub-menu.

## Create a Verification Step in Recording Mode

The <a href="/automated-tests/recording/hover-over-highlighting" target="_blank">Highlighting menu</a> gives quick access to a set of predefined verifications, which can be added with a single click while recording. You can follow the below steps to insert a quick verification step in your test.

1.&nbsp; Create a test and start a recording session. Navigate to the tested application - in this example we use a web test and the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/teststudio" target="_blank">Test Studio official page</a>.

2.&nbsp; This sample scenario clicks on the __Download Free Trial__ button and enables highlighting on the next page. Hold the mouse over the title and add a verification for its text content to ensure the correct product download is triggered.

3.&nbsp; Some of the <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-step-properties" target="_blank">step properties</a> are specific for the verification step and allow you to change the compare type or expected string value.

## Create a Verification Step without Recording Session

The automated test execution is much faster than a real user and often you find out it is suitable to __add an additional wait in the already recorded test__ to ensure its stability when running on different environments. For such cases Test Studio provides the <a href="/automated-tests/test-execution/partial-test-execution" target="_blank">options for partial test execution</a>, which allow you to get to a certain point of the test and record the additional waits.

For the cases when the project and scenarios are quite complex, you can __add verification steps for an already recorded element__ and without starting a recording session. The below list guide you through the steps for this:

1.&nbsp; Open a test in which you need to add a step. Choose an element from the __Elements Explorer__.
<br>
__Note:__  Usually, the verification step to insert is related to an action step and its element. Thus, if you click on that action step, its target element gets highlighted in the Elements Explorer with a red arrow. Select the element and proceed to the Step Builder.

2.&nbsp; Click the **Step Builder** pane to activate it. Under the __Actions__ and __Verification__ sections, you can see the options corresponding to the type of selected element.

3.&nbsp; Choose the verification you need and click the **Add Step** button to insert the step in the test.
