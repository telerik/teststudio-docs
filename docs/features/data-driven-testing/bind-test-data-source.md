# Bind Test to External Data Source

Test Studio allows you to use external data files for data driven testing. In this article you can read how to associate a test to an external data source.

If you have already related the external data source to a test in the project, follow <a href="/automated-tests/data-drive-test/external-data-driven-test" target="_blank">this link to go through a complete scenario for data driven test with external data source</a>.

## Bind the External Data Source to Test

Once you have <a href="/features/data-driven-testing/add-data-source" target="_blank">added a data source definition to your test project</a>, you are ready to bind your test to that data source.

Choose a test from the _Project Explorer_ and click the __Bind Test__ button from the _Data Source_ section in the _Project_ ribbon.

![choose-test-to-bind](/img/automated-tests/data-drive-test/bind-test-data-source/choose-test-to-bind.png)

The **Bind test to data source** dialog opens with the option to choose a data source. Click the **Select Data Source** drop-down and select the one you have  defined. If your source is an Excel spreadsheet, choose which sheet from the spreadsheet to use. Once you select a sheet, the data from that sheet will be read and displayed in the dialog. Check out that the __first row of the spreadsheet is used to define the column names__.

> You need to have __Microsoft Excel__ installed on this machine and/or the __Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010__ - see <a href="/troubleshooting-guide/test-execution-problems-tg/unable-to-show-data" target="_blank">this article</a> for more information.

## External Data Source Options

Some of the supported type of files to add as external data source allow you __to limit the rows__ of it to use. This option is applicable for Excel file or SQL database.

### Limit the Rows to Use from Excel File

If you need to use only part of the rows in an Excel sheet, you can enable the **Filter data between rows** box under the **Configure** section.

- If left unchecked, all data rows will be used during the test run.
- To limit which rows to use, check that box and select which rows you want to use by clicking the numeric up/down counters, and then **Update** to apply changes.

<table id="no-table" style="border:none;">
<tr style="text-align: center; background-color: transparent; border:none;">
<td>

![filter data][5]</td>
<td>

![filter data][6]</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Use Specific Data from SQL Data Source

If your source is a SQL database, you can use a T-SQL query to select the data you want. Using T-SQL, you can get as complex as you need in your SQL select statement. Check out the example below.

![SQL database][7]

Once your select statement is entered, click the **Update** button to test the results - the **Preview** table shows these.

## Confirm Data Binding

When the external data source is set as desired, click the __OK__ button to bind it to the selected test. Now the external file is associated with the test and you can access the data values to bind the steps.

## Remove Data Binding

To remove the external data source associated with a test, right click that test on the **Project** tab and select **Remove Data Binding**.
