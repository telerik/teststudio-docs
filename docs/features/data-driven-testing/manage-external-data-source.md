# Manage External Data Source

When a <a href="/features/data-driven-testing/add-data-source" target="_blank">data source is added in a Test Studio project</a>, it is actually copied to the **_ProjectRootFolder_\Data** sub-folder. This is the location, from where the file is accessed in test run-time, and any required changes in the data source must be applied to the file in this location. 

In order to modify any external data file, you can directly open it from the mentioned folder, or you can easily access it through Test Studio.

> __Tip__

> The project's root folder can be accessed through the <a href="/features/project-explorer/overview#project-context-menu-options" target="_blank">Project Explorer Context menu</a> using the option _Open Folder in Windows Explorer_.

## Access the Referenced External Data Sources

Click the **Manage** button from the _Data Source_ section in the _Project_ ribbon to open the _Manage Data Source_ dialog.

If you need to remove a data source from a Test Studio project, you need to remove its reference as well.
