**Execution**

- **BrowserType** - sets the browser the test executes on. Overrides the Settings.DefaultBrowser.
- **DisableDialogMonitoring** - whether to disable dialog monitoring and handling.
- **ReuseAppWindow** - useful in data-driven execution to define the number of iterations to reuse the application window. By default ('0') keeps the same application open during the entire test run.
- **StopTestListOnFailure** - gets or sets whether to stop test list execution if this test fails.

**Data**

- **DataEnabled** - whether data driven testing is enabled (if test is bound to a source).
- **DataRange** - defines a data range to execute within the data source set on a data driven test. Range is 1 based. Format: 'StartRow:EndRow' [i.e. '3:5'] or 'SingleRow' or ':3' (first three) or '3:' (three to end).
- **DataType*** - the data source type associated with this test.
- **DefaultToGrid** - when the BuiltInGrid is created in addition to an external data source, if set will default to the BuiltInGrid, else the external source.
- **HasBuiltInGrid*** - whether a BuiltInGrid is attached to this test.
- **InheritParentDataSource** - gets or sets whether this data-bound test will inherit the data source from its parent data-bound test.
- **IsDataDriven*** - whether the test is data driven.
- **Source*** - the data source bound to this test.
