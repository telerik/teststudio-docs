# Coded Step

The __Coded Step__ feature allows you to insert a coded function in the automation test. It directly opens the code editor and lets you input custom coded solution.

This article demonstrates how to add this type of step into the test.

Choose the __Coded Step__ option from the <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">__Step Builder__</a> and click on the __Add Step__ button in the lower right corner of the pane.
