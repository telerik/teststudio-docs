# API Test as Step

The __API test as step__ feature allows you to execute an <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio-apis/" target="_blank">API test</a> from the context of the other test types in Test Studio.

This article demonstrates how to add this type of step into the test.

Choose the __API Test as Step__ option from the <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">__Step Builder__</a> and click on the __Add Step__ button in the lower right corner of the pane.
