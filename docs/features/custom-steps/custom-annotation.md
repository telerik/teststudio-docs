# Custom Annotation


Add a note that displays in the browser when using the Quick Execution option. Use this to communicate with the test reviewer, or if you want to point out some information to the developer. For example, "This test step fails intermittently."


Some of the properties available for this step include: 

- **AnnotationText** text displayed on the screen.
- **DisplayLocation** where the annotation displays relative to the element.
- **DisplayTime** the number of milliseconds that the annotation displays.
