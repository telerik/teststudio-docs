# Clear Browser Cache

As of version 2015 R1 you can find the custom steps in the <a href="/getting-started/test-recording/step-suggestions" target="_blank">Step Builder</a> under General section.

![Add Clear Cache Step](/img/features/custom-steps/clear-browser-cache/fig3.png)

This step will clear ***all*** cookies, temp files or history from the active browser.

You can choose some or all of them.
 
This is useful when you want to start a clean test without saved information (like user name and password), or saved state information ("logged in," last visit date, preferences, etc.).
