# Browser and Desktop Capture

The __Capture Browser__ feature allows you to visually capture states at any point in a test and export them as PNG files to a specified folder. These images are larger and with higher quality than what is presented in the <a href="/features/test-maintenance/storyboard" target="_blank">Storyboard</a>.

This article demonstrates how to add this type of step into the test and use its properties.

## Add Capture Browser Step

Choose the __Capture Browser__ option from the <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">__Step Builder__</a> and click on the __Add Step__ button in the lower right corner of the pane.

## Find the Images from Capture Browser Step

The images from __Capture Browser__ step are generated and stored when the test is <a href="/automated-tests/test-lists/test-list-execution" target="_blank">executed as part of a test list</a>.

> __Important!__
> <br>
> <br>
> Images from __Capture Browser__ step are not stored to disk when the test is executed through the <a href="/automated-tests/test-execution/quick-execution" target="_blank">Quick Execution mode</a>. The following message appears in the log:
> ` Image not captured to disk. CreateLogFile is set to 'false'.`

To store the Browser and Desktop Capture images to disk include the test in a test list and edit <a href="/features/test-lists/test-list-settings" target="_blank">its settings</a>. Ensure **CreateLogFile** is enabled and, optionally, specify the output directory for the image captures in the __LogLocation__ setting.

> __Note!__

> If the user running the Test Studio process does not have permissions to write in the folder specified in the test list settings, the __execution process automatically saves the images in %PUBLIC%\WebAiiLog__.

## Find the Images from Capture Browser Step in Visual Studio Execution
