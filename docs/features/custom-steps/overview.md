# Use the Step Builder to Add Steps

The Advanced Recording Tools window can help build a wide range of automation and verification quickly and without having to resort to manual configuration. There are some common steps like adding a comment, or clearing the browser cache, which need to be added outside of the recorded actions. The __Step Builder__ pane in the project area provides a list of these additional steps and let's you maintain them in the tests.

Depending on the <a href="/automated-tests/customize-project/custom-layout" target="_blank">Test Studio project's layout</a> you use, the __Step Builder__ pane could be located on different place - usually on the right side of the project area, either <a href="/automated-tests/customize-project/custom-layout#hide-or-show-a-panel" target="_blank">pinned or hidden</a>.

## Add Step for a Recorded Element

The Step Builder can also be used to build steps against already recorded elements in the <a href="/features/elements-explorer/overview" target="_blank">Elements Explorer</a>.

1.&nbsp; Open a test in which you need to add a step. Choose an element from the __Elements Explorer__.

2.&nbsp; Click the **Step Builder** pane to activate it. Under the __Actions__ and __Verification__ sections, you can see the options corresponding to the type of selected element.

3.&nbsp; Choose the action or verification you need and click the **Add Step** button to insert the step in the test.

## Add a General Step from the Step Builder

The __General__ section in the __Step Builder__ is divided in three sub-sections - __Common__, __Conditions__ and __Dialogs__.

- The __Conditions__ section provides the option to add the built-in logical blocks - <a href="/features/logical-steps/if-else" target="_blank">if..else</a>, <a href="/features/logical-steps/loop" target="_blank">loop</a> and <a href="/features/logical-steps/while-loop" target="_blank">while..loop</a>.

- The __Dialogs__ section allows you to manually add steps for <a href="/features/dialogs-and-popups/dialogs" target="_blank">handling different dialogs</a>.

- The __Common__ section consists of different steps suggestions based on the type of test - web, desktop or WPF.
