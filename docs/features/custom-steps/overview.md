# Add a Custom Step from Step Builder #

## Test Studio 2015 R1 (v.2015.1.319) and Later ##

The Recording Surface can help build a wide range of automation and verification quickly and without having to resort to manual configuration. However, there are some steps that need to be added manually.

As of version 2015 R1 you can find the custom steps in the <a href="/getting-started/test-recording/step-suggestions" target="_blank">Step Builder</a> under General section.
