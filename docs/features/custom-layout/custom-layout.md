# Customize Test Studio's Layout


Since the release of the R1 2015, Test Studio provides the ability to customize the layout. You can reorder the default layout (the Compact layout) and customize it for your own needs and personal preferences.

![default layout][1]

You have some preset layouts such as Compact (default), High Productivity and Advanced.

If you would like to create a Custom layout and rearrange some of the panes you simply click on the Undock button ![undock][3] and select preferred position for the dock where to appear (top, bottom, left or right).

![choose position][4]

> You can also use drag and drop in order to rearrange panes.

If you choose the center (see below):

![choose center][5]

the pane will appear as a tab:

![tabs][6]

Using the pin button ![pin][7] will auto hide the pane, and it will appear as a tab on the side, and you can call the pane when hover over with the mouse.

Once you are done with your custom layout, do not miss to click Save Custom Layout from the dropdown.

![save custom][9]

> In case you would like to reset to the default layout you simply need to select Compact from the layout dropdown.
