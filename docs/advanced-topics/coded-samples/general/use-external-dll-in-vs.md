# Use External DLL in VS 

*I need to reference and use an external DLL that contains global functions from a coded step in Visual Studio.*

## Solution 

You'll find an attached sample Visual Studio Solution attached at bottom of the page. The solution contains two projects. One is a Test Studio project and the other is a "normal" Class Library Project. We use functions from the Class Library inside a coded step in the test project.

Note that the functions in the "Utility" project are contained within a non-static class. The constructor for this class takes the Manager object from the test project as an argument. Take a close look at this implementation because it allows the "Utility" project to directly interact with the test object.
