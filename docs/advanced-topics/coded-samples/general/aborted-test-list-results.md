# Record results even if test list execution is aborted 

*I would like to have results file for the already executed tests if the test list execution is aborted at an earlier stage.*

## Solution 

Test Studio has the ability to store run results on each executed step and this could be turned on within the ***Telerik.TestStudio.Desktop.exe.config*** file. For the default installation, the file could be found in the following folder: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Test Studio\Bin*. Open the file in a text editor and set the **'PersistOnEachStep'** key value to True.

 

````XML
  <appSettings>
      <add key="CommandLineRun" value="True" />
      <add key="PersistOnEachStep" value="False" />
  </appSettings>
````

## Command line runner arguments 

If you execute tests from <a href="/features/test-runners/artoftest-runner" target="_blank">the command line runner</a> you could set that value to "true" by passing an argument to the command to be executed. The 'PersistOnEachStep' is one of the general options available for modifying the command line test execution behavior.
