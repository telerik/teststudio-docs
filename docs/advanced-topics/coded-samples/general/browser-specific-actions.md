# Invoke Browser-Specific Actions 

*I would like to invoke browser-specific actions in a standard or coded step. This means the step is only executed if the test is running in the specified browser type.*

## Solution 

Use a standard (non-coded) step or use a coded solution.

The **RunsAgainst** Test Step Property allows you to choose against which browser to run the step:

![RunsAgainst][1]

Keep in mind that if you use this feature, the step will run against the specified browser only. You can only choose one browser and not, for instance, two out of three browsers. (To accomplish that, copy and paste the step, then change the RunsAgainst property for the new step.)

You can  put together a much more complex use-case by using a coded solution. Here's the code from the test sample. It demonstrates how to use a different search word based on browser type:

````C#
ActiveBrowser.NavigateTo("http://www.telerik.com/"); 
//Navigate to the page
  
HtmlInputText it = Find.ById<HtmlInputText>("~txtSearchBox_tbSanitized"); //Find the text input field with a "contains" type of search
  
Log.WriteLine("Test is executing in the following browser:" + ActiveBrowser.BrowserType.ToString()); 
//Write the browser type to the log
              
            switch (ActiveBrowser.BrowserType) //Input a specific String depending on the browser in which the test is running 
            {
                case BrowserType.InternetExplorer:
                    it.Text = "Internet Explorer";
                    break;
  
                case BrowserType.FireFox:
                    it.Text = "FireFox";
                    break;
  
                case BrowserType.Chrome:
                    it.Text = "Chrome";
                    break;
            }
  
Find.ById<HtmlInputSubmit>("~btnSearchSubmit").Click(); //Click submit button
System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(2000); //Wait a bit so we can see the result
````
````VB
ActiveBrowser.NavigateTo("http://www.telerik.com/")
'Navigate to the page
  
Dim it As HtmlInputText = Find.ById(Of HtmlInputText)("~txtSearchBox_tbSanitized")
'Find the text input field with a "contains" type of search
Log.WriteLine("Test is executing in the following browser:" + ActiveBrowser.BrowserType.ToString())
'Write the browser type to the log
  
Select Case ActiveBrowser.BrowserType
    'Input a specific String depending on the browser in which the test is running 
    Case BrowserType.InternetExplorer
        it.Text = "Internet Explorer"
        Exit Select
  
    Case BrowserType.FireFox
        it.Text = "FireFox"
        Exit Select
  
    Case BrowserType.Chrome
        it.Text = "Chrome"
        Exit Select
End Select
  
Find.ById(Of HtmlInputSubmit)("~btnSearchSubmit").Click()
'Click submit button
System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(2000)
'Wait a bit so we can see the result
````

The coded solution is also applicable to the Telerik Testing Framework.
