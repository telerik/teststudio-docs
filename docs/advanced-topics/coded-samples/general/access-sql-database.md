# How to Access a SQL Database in Code

> You can access an SQL database in a data driven test, as seen <a href="/features/data-driven-testing/add-data-source#add-a-database-source" target="_blank">here</a>. This is built-in functionality for Test Studio, but not for Telerik Testing Framework. This article demonstrates how to access a SQL database through code, which allows for greater flexibility. Also, writing into a database is only possible with a coded solution.

##Add Assembly Reference##

Use the *System.Data.SqlClient* API. You'll need to add an assembly reference to it, as seen <a href="/advanced-topics/coded-steps/add-assembly-reference" target="_blank">here</a>. This API is part of the *System.Data* assembly. This assembly is located, by default, in the following location (on a 64-bit Windows 7 machine with .NET 4.0):

**C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETFramework\v4.0\Profile\Client\System.Data.dll**

If a reference to System.Data 2.0 already exists, remove it add it again from the above directory for the 4.0 version.

Ensure you add the *using* or *Imports* statement to the top of the code-behind file. Click the View Class button, scroll to the top of the code, and add this line:

```C#
using System.Data.SqlClient;
```
```VB
Imports System.Data.SqlClient;
```

##Sample Code##

Here we've create a SQL database named **myFirstDB**. This database contains a table named **Table_1**. This table contains a column named **City**.

![Database][1]

###Read from SQL Database###

```C#
//Define a new SQL connection with a connection string. 
//The connection string will be different depending on your environment and the name of the database, table, etc.
//See http://www.connectionstrings.com for connection string examples.
SqlConnection thisConnection = new SqlConnection("Data Source=MACHINENAME\\SQLEXPRESS; Initial Catalog=myFirstDB; Integrated Security=true;"); 
thisConnection.Open();
 
//Write the name of the database to the log
Log.WriteLine(thisConnection.Database);
 
//Create an SQL command
SqlCommand thisCommand = thisConnection.CreateCommand();
 
//This is a simple SQL command that will go through all the values in the "City" column from the table "Table_1"
thisCommand.CommandText = "SELECT City FROM Table_1";
SqlDataReader thisReader = thisCommand.ExecuteReader();
while (thisReader.Read())
{
    Log.WriteLine("Value of City column: " + (String) thisReader["City"]);
}
 
thisReader.Close();
thisConnection.Close();
```
```VB
'Define a new SQL connection with a connection string. 
'The connection string will be different depending on your environment and the name of the database, table, etc.
'See http://www.connectionstrings.com for connection string examples.
Dim thisConnection As New SqlConnection("Data Source=MACHINENAME\SQLEXPRESS; Initial Catalog=myFirstDB; Integrated Security=true;")
thisConnection.Open()
 
'Write the name of the database to the log
Log.WriteLine(thisConnection.Database)
 
'Create an SQL command
Dim thisCommand As SqlCommand = thisConnection.CreateCommand()
 
'This is a simple SQL command that will go through all the values in the "City" column from the table "Table_1"
thisCommand.CommandText = "SELECT City FROM Table_1"
Dim thisReader As SqlDataReader = thisCommand.ExecuteReader()
While thisReader.Read()
    Log.WriteLine("Value of City column: " + DirectCast(thisReader("City"), [String]))
End While
 
thisReader.Close()
thisConnection.Close()
```

###Write into SQL Database###

```C#
//Define a new SQL connection with a connection string.
//The connection string will be different depending on your environment and the name of the database, table, etc.
//See http://www.connectionstrings.com for connection string examples.
SqlConnection thisConnection = new SqlConnection("Data Source=MACHINENAME\\SQLEXPRESS; Initial Catalog=myFirstDB; Integrated Security=true;");
thisConnection.Open();
 
//Write the name of the database to the log.
Log.WriteLine(thisConnection.Database);
 
//Create a SQL command to insert a new value into the "City" column.
SqlCommand thisCommand = thisConnection.CreateCommand();
thisCommand.CommandText = "INSERT INTO Table_1 (City) VALUES ('Richmond')";
thisCommand.ExecuteNonQuery();
```
```VB
'Define a new SQL connection with a connection string.
'The connection string will be different depending on your environment and the name of the database, table, etc.
'See http://www.connectionstrings.com for connection string examples.
Dim thisConnection As New SqlConnection("Data Source=MACHINENAME\SQLEXPRESS; Initial Catalog=myFirstDB; Integrated Security=true;")
thisConnection.Open()
 
'Write the name of the database to the log.
Log.WriteLine(thisConnection.Database)
 
'Create a SQL command to insert a new value into the "City" column.
Dim thisCommand As SqlCommand = thisConnection.CreateCommand()
thisCommand.CommandText = "INSERT INTO Table_1 (City) VALUES ('Richmond')"
thisCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()
```

**Note**: This code won't run without modification. The database, table, and column in the original code won't exist in your environment.
