# Common HTML Find Expressions

*I would like to click on a hyperlink based on its text value. I prefer to do this in code and not by editing an existing element's <a href="/features/elements-explorer/find-element" target="_blank">Find Settings</a>*.

## Solution

Let's use <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">wikipedia.org</a> as an example. First we'll find and click the top bold English link.

![wikipedia][1]

Here's the HTML code for that link:

````HTML
<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/" title="English — Wikipedia — The Free Encyclopedia">
<strong>English</strong>
<br>
<em>The Free Encyclopedia</em>
<br>
<small>3 907 000+ articles</small>
</a>
````

The anchor element has no direct TextContent, so we'll need to locate by a partial match on InnerText:

````C#
HtmlAnchor a = Find.ByExpression<HtmlAnchor>("InnerText=~English", "tagname=a");
Assert.IsNotNull(a);
a.Click();
````
````VB
Dim a As HtmlAnchor = Find.ByExpression(Of HtmlAnchor)("InnerText=~English", "tagname=a")
Assert.IsNotNull(a)
a.Click()
````

If we locate by an exact match on TextContent, the bottom *English* link will found.

![english link][2]

Here's the HTML code for that link:

````HTML
<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/" lang="en">English</a>
````

Here's how to locate and click that link:

````C#
HtmlAnchor a = Find.ByExpression<HtmlAnchor>("TextContent=English", "tagname=a");
Assert.IsNotNull(a);
a.Click();
````
````VB
Dim a As HtmlAnchor = Find.ByExpression(Of HtmlAnchor)("TextContent=English", "tagname=a")
Assert.IsNotNull(a)
a.Click()
````

The following attributes apply to both links, however Test Studio returns the first HtmlAnchor that matches. In this case, that's the top bold *English* link.

````C#
HtmlAnchor a = Find.ByExpression<HtmlAnchor>("tagname=a", "href=//en.wikipedia.org/");
````
````VB
Dim a As HtmlAnchor = Find.ByExpression(Of HtmlAnchor)("tagname=a", "href=//en.wikipedia.org/")
````

You can find it by xpath:

````C#
HtmlAnchor a = Find.ByXPath<HtmlAnchor>("//*[@id=\"www-wikipedia-org\"]/div[5]/div/a[2]");
````
````VB
Dim a As HtmlAnchor = Find.ByXPath(Of HtmlAnchor)("//*[@id=""www-wikipedia-org""]/div[5]/div/a[2]")
````

You can also data drive the find expression:

````C#
HtmlAnchor a = Find.ByExpression<HtmlAnchor>("tagname=a", "textcontent=" + Data["Col1"].ToString());
````
````VB
Dim a As HtmlAnchor = Find.ByExpression(Of HtmlAnchor)("tagname=a", "textcontent=" + Data("Col1").ToString())
````
