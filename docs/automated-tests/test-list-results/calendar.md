# Test List Results Calendar

The results generated from a test list execution are stored on project level and populated in the __Results__ tab in the Test Studio project. All results are listed in a handy graphic calendar or timeline display and you can track the outcome of your test lists.

This article describes the Results calendar options and how these can help you.

## View Overall Results Status

In the __Results__ tab you can view the test lists executions in a month, week, or day. Buttons along the top, let you jump between _Day_, _Week_, _Month_, and _Timeline_ views.

Each test list result is displayed as colored block - green for _Passed_ run, red for _Failed_ run, and yellow for an _upcoming scheduled test list execution_.

## Navigate through Calendar Dates

In the upper right corner you can find _navigation arrow buttons_, which allow you to move back and forward through a period of time (one week), based on the current view. Between these arrows, there is a _calendar button_, which can be used to jump to a specific date selected from the pop-up calendar.

><br>
> Results are displayed in the order of their exact execution time. Thus these cannot be moved around in the calendar.

> __Test list results can be deleted__ using the _X_ button, which appears for each result entry when hovered with the mouse.
