# Welcome Screen

Once you successfully <a href="/prerequisites/license-activation/activating-your-license" target="_blank">activate a Test Studio license</a> and launch the app, it takes you to the **Welcome Screen**. In this view you can create or open an existing project and access useful samples and tutorials resources.

This article guieds you throught the different tabs of the **Welcome Screen**:

* [Project Section](#project-section)
* [Get Started Section](#get-started-section)
* [News Feed Section](#news-feed-section)

## Project Section

In the __Project__ section of the __Welcome screen__, you can choose between creating a [new project](#create-a-new-project) or [opening an existing one](#open-an-existing-project). You can pick from a list of recently used projects on the left, or browse your local folders through the _Open Local_ button. You can also [open a remote project from a source control repository](#open-source-control) (Git or TFS).

### Create a New Project

To create a new project you can choose from several types of testing - __Web Testing__, __Desktop Testing__, __WPF Testing__ or __Load Testing__ projects (Load testing is only available in Test Studio Ultimate). Test Studio projects maintain  all type of tests, but depending on your choice a test of the selected type gets created with the new project.

To create a new project:

1. Choose the type of testing to start with.

1. Set the project name and, optionally, change the location folder where Test Studio projects are stored.

1. Confirm the creation with pressing the __OK__ button. The __Cancel__ button returns you to the previous screen.

The default location where Test Studio creates projects is *C:\Users\<yourUsername>\Documents\Test Studio Projects*. The __Browse Folder__ button allows you to change this by choosing another folder.

### Open an Existing Project

The **Recent projects** section on the left shows a list of the projects you worked on lately - these are listed with their name and folder location. The _Delete_ icon removes the project from the list and does not remove the actual files from disc. 

The __Open Local Project__ option let's you browse to a local folder which contains a Test Studio project to load.

### Open Source Control

Test Studio provides built-in integration for TFVC and Git based repositories. The __Open Source Control__ option let's you specify a remote repository to clone locally - you can choose from <a href ="/automated-tests/source-control/git/open-git-project" target="_blank">Git</a> or <a href ="/automated-tests/source-control/tfs/open-tfs-project" target="_blank">TFS</a>.

> Once you open the test project, you can <a href ="/automated-tests/customize-project/custom-layout" target="_blank">adjust the Test Studio layout</a> and make it fit your environment and needs.
