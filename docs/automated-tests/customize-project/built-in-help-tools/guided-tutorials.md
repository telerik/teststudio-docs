# Guided Tutorials

Have a smooth getting started experience with the guided interactive tutorials built-in in Test Studio.

## Start a Guided Tutorial

You can start a tutorial from the Test Studio [**Welcome Screen**](/automated-tests/customize-project/welcome-screen#get-started) or from within the product.

<tr>
<td>![Welcome Screen][1]<br>**Start from Welcome Screen**</td>
<td>![In-product][2]<br>**Start In-Product**</td>
<tr>
<table>

## Scenarios to Guide You Through

Each of the interactive scenarios will guide you through the minimum required steps to start automating tests with Test Studio:

- record a test
- execute a successful test
- explore the [step failure details]() after executing a failing test

When you start a tutorial, the Test Studio window gets grayed out, while the element on focus stays active, and you see a hint with the required action.

The hints popup contains information about the upcoming steps and allows you to stop the tutorial at any time. You can also use the *'Escape'* button on your keyboard to end the tutorial.
