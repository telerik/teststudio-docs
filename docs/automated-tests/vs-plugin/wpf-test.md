# Create and Record a WPF Test (VS plugin) 

The feature of Test Studio to record tests by capturing your actions against the tested application is also available in the context of the Visual Studio project.

In this article you can find how to add and record a new WPF test in the Visual Studio plugin project for Test Studio.

## Create a WPF Test

Click with the right mouse button on the project name in __Solution Explorer__, select the __Add...__ option and choose the __Test Studio WPF Test...__ option.

The chosen item is selected in the list of items and you can enter name for the test. Then click the __Add__ button to insert it in the project.

![Add][4]

To open the test, double click on its name in the Solution Explorer. The WPF test requires the path to the tested application to be configured before you can start recording. Click the __Configure WPF Application__ button in the toolbar to open the window with the WPF test settings.

![Configure WPF app button][5]

The __Configure WPF Application Path__ window appears and you can insert the necessary information:

* <a href="/automated-tests/wpf/wpf-test#choose-the-application-to-automate" target="_blank">Choose the WPF application to automate</a>
* <a href="/automated-tests/wpf/wpf-test#set-default-wpf-application-path" target="_blank">Set default WPF Application path</a>
* <a href="/automated-tests/wpf/wpf-test#record-application-window-state" target="_blank">Record application Window State</a>

Confirm the applied changes with __OK__ button.
