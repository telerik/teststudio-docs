# Quick Access to BaseUrl

The **Test** ribbon in Test Studio allows you to trigger a quick test execution and provides access to the **BaseUrl** project setting.

## Using BaseUrl in Test Studio Projects

Test Studio allows you to reuse already recorded tests against multiple environments, for example, stage, test, or production. Usually, these environments differ only in their URLs, so changing the **BaseUrl** on the project level will help you execute the same tests against multiple environments.

To change the **BaseUrl**, go to the **Test** ribbon and enter the desired URL in the designated field.

## Adjust the Compare Mode for URLs

When a **BaseUrl** is set for the project, you can change the **Compare Mode** for future recorded elements. For more information about the various options, see the <a href="/features/project-settings/recording-options#elements-page-compare-mode" target="_blank">Compare Mode section</a> in the Recording Options article.
