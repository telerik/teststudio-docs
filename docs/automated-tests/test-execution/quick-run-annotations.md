# Annotations in Quick Execution

The **Test** ribbon in Test Studio allows you to trigger a quick test execution and enable annotations for the target elements in each test step.

The annotations highlight the target element in each executed step and provide a brief message for the action in the step. The annotations are helpful when the sequence of actions is hard to follow, and it's hard to identify which action causes the unexpected application behavior during the test execution.

To enable or disable annotations, go to the **Test** ribbon and click the annotations button.

When you enable annotations, Test Studio slows down the test run by inserting a delay (in milliseconds) between steps. You can change the delay either from the drop-down menu or by entering a custom value.
