## Enable or Disable Highlighting of Elements

Once in an active recording session you can enable or disable the _highlighting_ from the <a href="/features/recorder/compact-recording-toolbar" target="_blank">**Compact Recording Toolbar**</a>.

> **Note**

> The highlighting feature __can be enabled (or disabled) even when the recording is paused__.

When enabled and the mouse pointer pauses over an element in the recording surface of the tested application, you will see the __Elements menu__ with multiple options. This rich menu makes it easy to work with the recording surface and its elements. It provides quick access to relevant functions right in the application you are testing.

> Use the *Pause/Break* key on your keyboard to toggle on or off the Highlighting feature.

## __Options in the Highlighting Menu__

The __Elements Menu__ provides access to various actions and functions apart from the straightforward _click_ or _type_ actions. These are divided in few sections to speed up their usage. Read below what options there are in the different sub-menus.

## Quick Steps

__Quick Steps__ sub-menu provides a list of tasks, which can be performed against the highlighted element - these are context sensitive and are different depending on the target element. There are few options listed to add a <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/quick-verification" target="_blank">__quick verification__</a>, a <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/wait" target="_blank">__wait step__</a> or <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/extraction" target="_blank">__to extract any of the element's attributes__</a>, based on its specifics.

![Quick Steps Sub-menu](/img/automated-tests/recording/highlighting/fig4.png)

## Mouse Actions

__Mouse Actions__ sub-menu provides <a href="/features/recorder/highlighting-menu/mouse-actions" target="_blank">quick access to different type of click steps</a> like double-click, right mouse click, mouse key up or down, mouse hover over action, etc. Mouse click steps get __recorded with default coordinates__ to target the absolute center of element. If you need to specify the coordinates for a click action you can use the <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/actions/adv-mouse-actions#specify-the-click-location" target="_blank">advanced mouse click actions</a> and modify these.  

![Mouse Actions Sub-menu](/img/automated-tests/recording/highlighting/fig5.png)

> **Tip**
> <br>
> <br>
> The __Drag and Drop action__ requires the selection of the element to drag and the element to drop it to. Therefore, this can only be <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/actions/drag-and-drop" target="_blank">added through the Advanced Recording Tools</a>.

## Scroll Actions

In certain occasions you may need to scroll the page and change the visible part of it. The <a href="/features/recorder/highlighting-menu/scroll-actions" target="_blank">__Scroll Actions__ sub-menu</a> gives the options to choose an element on application screen and scroll it to the top, bottom or center of the page.

![Scroll Actions Sub-menu](/img/automated-tests/recording/highlighting/fig6.png)

> **Note**
> <br>
> <br>
> The __<a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/steps-overview" target="_blank">Element Steps</a> tab in the Advanced Recording Tools__ provides the full set of steps available for the selected element. 

## Add to Elements

**Add to Elements** option allows you to add the highlighted element to the selected test in project as an _'external reference'_ - that means the element is not related to any step from the test, but is still listed in it and can be referred from a coded step, for example.

![Add to Elements][5]

## Locate in DOM

**Locate in DOM** is an option, which directly opens the <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/dom-explorer" target="_blank">DOM Explorer in the __Advanced Recording Tools__</a> and selects the highlighted element in the DOM structure of the page. You can further explore the surrounding elements of the selected one, or use the options for building a step using this element.

![Locate in DOM][6]

## Build Step

**Build Step...** is an option very similar to the __Locate In DOM__ one - it selects the highlighted element in the DOM tree and directly switches to the <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/steps-overview" target="_blank">Element Steps</a> tab in the __Advanced Recording Tools__.

![Build Step][7]

There are additional actions and verifications you can add against the selected element. For example, you can add mouse actions and <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/advanced-verification" target="_blank">advanced verification steps</a> for attribute, image or text from image.
