## Description

I need to automate a process that involves solving a Captcha as part of the steps. Is there any solution or workaround to achieve this during automation testing?

This knowledge base article also answers the following questions:
- How to bypass Captcha during automation testing?
- What are the options for handling Captcha in Telerik Test Studio?
- Can Captcha be automated in test environments?

## Solution

Captchas are specifically designed to prevent automation for security purposes, including tools like Telerik Test Studio. However, there are alternative approaches you can consider during testing:

1. **Whitelist Company Test IP:** Add your company's or test machineâ€™s IP to the trusted list to bypass Captcha verification during testing.

2. **Disable Captcha in Test Environment:** Turn off Captcha in testing environments such as staging or development while keeping it enabled in production.

3. **Use Image-Based Element Identification:** For certain weak Captchas, you might use image-based element identification. This should only be a last resort if other options are unavailable.

   - To identify an element by image for a single test step, enable `SearchByImageFirst` in the [step properties](https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/features/test-maintenance/test-step-properties).  
   - To set image-based identification for the entire project, enable the checkbox `Search by image first` in the [Find Logic project settings](https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/features/project-settings/find-logic).

Discuss the most suitable approach with your development team to align with your requirements.
