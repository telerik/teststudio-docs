#Multiple Projects

When multiple projects use the same or similar resources, you may wish to share or integrate these project resources. Here we address four scenarios: Sharing helper methods between projects, sharing data sources between projects, and importing tests from other projects.

##Sharing Helper Methods Between Projects

If your projects use common methods, you may wish to place them in a custom DLL. You can then add references to this utility class in your different projects in <a href="/advanced-topics/coded-samples/general/utility-class-in-standalone" target="_blank">Standalone Test Studio</a> or the <a href="/advanced-topics/coded-samples/general/use-external-dll-in-vs" target="_blank">Visual Studio Plugin</a>.

##Sharing Data Sources Between Projects

Generally, <a href="/features/data-driven-testing/bind-test-data-source" target="_blank">data sources</a> must be in the same project folder as the tests bound to them. Test Studio creates a copy of the target data source for this purpose, so that after data binding, changes to the original data source do not automatically affect the data source for the test. 

A <a href="/features/data-driven-testing/sql-database-example" target="_blank">SQL database</a>, however, behaves differently: any test configured to connect to a SQL database as a data source will retrieve up-to-date data from that database. So, any number of projects can data bind to the same SQL database and access the same data.

##Importing Tests from Another Project

All Test Studio projects are file-based. To import tests from one project to another, you can copy the test files (.tstest) from those projects into the target project. Next, manually <a href="/troubleshooting-guide/test-execution-problems-tg/pages-not-defined" target="_blank">update the namespace</a> for any copied code-behind files. Test Studio will automatically detect this new test on restart or Project view refresh.
