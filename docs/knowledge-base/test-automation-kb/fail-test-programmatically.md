## Fail Step or Test Programatically

## PROBLEM

All steps are successfully executed, but you might need to still fail the test due to internal errors in the application. Consider adding a verification step to ensure the state of the application is correct. In case there is no such verification available, you can apply the proposed solution.

## SOLUTION

You can change the result from specific step or the entire test programmatically, after the test is completed. To do that, you need to <a href="/advanced-topics/coded-samples/general/custom-scripts-before-after" target="_blank">override the method **OnAfterTestCompleted()**</a> in a coded step.

1.&nbsp; Add a <a href="/features/custom-steps/script-step" target="_blank">coded step</a> to the current test.

2.&nbsp; Override the **OnAfterTestCompleted()** method outside of the coded step method. The logic inside this method will be executed after the last step of the test.

3.&nbsp; Find a specific condition, which will be used to evaluate the state of the application and whether the step or test should be marked as failed.
