## Using the ClosesBrowser Property for Pop-ups

Pop-ups can have a control (usually a button) which invokes an event that closes the pop-up. This can cause problems when performing UI Automation with Test Studio.

## Solution

"Click"-type of steps have a property called "ClosesBrowser":

![ClosesBrowser property][1]

Depending on the implementation of the pop-up, Test Studio may or may not detect the cases where this property needs to be set to Ttrue. Symptoms related to this issue can be:

* Click steps timing out after the actual click occurred during execution.

* Click steps failing with a seemingly random exception message:

	*ExecuteCommand failed:
	BrowserCommand
	(Type:'Information', Info:'IsReady', Action:'NotSet', Tergaet:'null', Data:'', ClientID:'Client_034ab38c-2736-49b3-9b45-986d2990bc07', HasFrames:'False', frameInfo:'', TargetFrameIndex:'-1', InError:'False', Response:'')
	InnerException: System.IO.IOException: **Pipe is broken**.
		at System.IO.Pipes.PipeStream.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode)
		at System.IO.Pipes.PipeStream.WaitForpipeDrain()*

* If the click step is followed by a "Close pop-up window" step, this likely indicates the button invokes a Closing event. However, this problem can occur even if your test contains no "Connect to pop-up window" or "Close pop-up window" steps. This is because some pop-ups are implemented in a non-standard way. In these cases, set ClosesBrowser to True. Select the "Click" step, then change this setting from the Property menu on the right.

* Setting the Click step's **SimulateRealClick** property to True resolves the issue.
