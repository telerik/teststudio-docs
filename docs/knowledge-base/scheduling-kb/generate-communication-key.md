# Generate New Communication Key 

The **Communication Key** is required by all Test Studio Scheduling components - services and clients, to establish the connection and communicate between each other. You can get the current key or generate a new one in the <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/multiple-machines-scheduling-setup/create-scheduling-server" target="_blank">Scheduling Config wizard</a>. 

## Manage the Communication Key

Find useful details on the available options to manage the Communication key value.

### Default Communication Key 

The **Communication** tab in the Scheduling Config wizard lets you manage the current key in use or generate and import a new one. 

![Communication key tab](/img/features//scheduling-test-runs/create-scheduling-server/communication-tab.png)

The **Current Key** section indicates which is the key in use. The Scheduling setup is configured to use a default communication key for each Test Studio installation. Thus, after initial install you see the current key is the __Default Key Loaded__. In this configuration you can't copy or see the key.

### Generate New Key

The **Replace Key** section lets you **Generate** a new key. Once generated, the new value is populated in the text field and is ready to be imported. Hit the **Import** button to replace the current key with the new one.

> The Execution Client application is stopped but you need to start it manually. 
> If Test Studio application is also running on the same machine at the time of renewing the communication key, it is not automatically restarted. To apply the recent changes you __need to restart the standalone Test Studio app manually__. 


### Copy Current Key

Once a custom key is generated and imported, the **Current Key** section allows you to copy the value of the key using the __Copy to Clipboard__ button, or see it using the __Show__ button (for the cases when copying is not an option). The key value can be reset to the default value using the __Reset to Default__ button.

The copied key must be imported on all machines included in the Test Studio Scheduling setup.

> **Note**
> <br>
> <br>
> The communication key is set per machine. This means that importing a key on one machine lets all other components on the same machine to use it. If you see any troubles with the imported key on a machine, be sure to restart all Test Studio processes. 

## Importing New Key in Single Machine Scheduling Setup 

Once you generate a new key, hit the **Import** button to replace the current key in use for the Scheduling service. This triggers restart of the service to take the new key and restart of the Execution client application. 

In the setup where all components of the Scheduling configuration are on the same machine, you only need to restart all Test Studio processes to ensure the new key is imported. Follow the below steps: 

1. Open the <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/multiple-machines-scheduling-setup/create-scheduling-server#start-the-test-studio-scheduling-config-wizard" target="_blank">Scheduling config wizard</a>. 
1. Switch to the <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/multiple-machines-scheduling-setup/create-scheduling-server#communication-tab" target="_blank">Communication tab</a> and generate new communication key. 
2. Hit the **Import** button and wait for a while.

3. The Scheduling service is restarted in the background. 
4. The <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/multiple-machines-scheduling-setup/create-execution-server#start-the-execution-client" target="_blank">Execution client application from the system tray</a> is restarted. 
   
    __Note!__ You may see a message that the Execution server app is closed and you need to start it manually.

5. Restart Test Studio standalone application. 
6. Continue with <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/connect-to-scheduling-server" target="_blank">connecting the project to the Scheduler</a> and scheduling test lists. 

### Importing New Key in Multiple Machines Scheduling Setup 

Once you generate a new key, hit the **Import** button to replace the current key in use for the Scheduling service. This triggers restart of the service to take the new key and restart of the Execution client application on that same machine. 

In the setup where all components of the Scheduling configuration are on different machines, you need to __import the new key on each machine__. Follow the below steps: 

1. Open the <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/multiple-machines-scheduling-setup/create-scheduling-server#start-the-test-studio-scheduling-config-wizard" target="_blank">Scheduling config wizard</a> on the machine where the Scheduling service is. 
2. In the <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/multiple-machines-scheduling-setup/create-scheduling-server#communication-tab" target="_blank">Communicaion tab</a> generate new communication key. 
3. Hit the **Import** button and wait for a while. 
   
    ![Generate Key](/img/knowledge-base/scheduling-kb/communication-key/generate-key.png)

4. The Scheduling service is restarted in the background. 
5. The <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/multiple-machines-scheduling-setup/create-execution-server#start-the-execution-client" target="_blank">Execution client application from the system tray</a> on this machine is restarted. 
   
    __Note!__ You may see a message that the Execution server app is closed and you need to start it manually. 
    ![Restart Execution server](/img/knowledge-base/scheduling-kb/communication-key/restart-exec-server.png)

6. On this same machine copy the new key value from the __Current Key__ section in the Scheduling config wizard->Communication tab. 

    ![Copy current Key](/img/knowledge-base/scheduling-kb/communication-key/copy-current-key.png)

7. Logon to each of the machine utilized as Execution servers in the Scheduling setup.
8. <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/multiple-machines-scheduling-setup/create-scheduling-server#start-the-test-studio-scheduling-config-wizard" target="_blank">Start the Test Studio Services configuration wizard</a>.
9. Switch to the Communication tab and use the copied key from the Scheduling machine (Step 6. in this list) to import it. 
    
    ![Import new Key](/img/knowledge-base/scheduling-kb/communication-key/replace-key.png)

10. Hit the **Import** button and wait for a while.
11. If running the <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/multiple-machines-scheduling-setup/create-execution-server#start-the-execution-client" target="_blank">Execution client application from the system tray</a> is restarted. 
   
    __Note!__ You may see a message that the Execution server app is closed and you need to start it manually.

12. If the machine with the project is a separate machine repeat steps 8. to 10. also for it. If Test Studio application is running while importing the new key be sure to restart it. 
13. Continue with <a href="/automated-tests/scheduling/connect-to-scheduling-server" target="_blank">connecting the project to the Scheduler</a> and scheduling test lists.
