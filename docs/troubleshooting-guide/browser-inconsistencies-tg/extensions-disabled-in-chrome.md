# Chrome Extensions Disabled

From Chrome version 35 and above due to security reasons, extensions can be installed only if they are hosted on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>. With this change, extensions that were previously  installed (ex. Test Studio Extensions) may be automatically disabled, and cannot be re-enabled or re-installed until they are hosted on the Chrome Web Store.

For your convenience we are providing you the download links for the latest Chrome extensions below:

**Test Studio 2017 R3 (v. 2017.3.1010) And Later**

There is a single extension combining recording and execution: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/progress-test-studio-exte/gegcllkonmciadpdldechnepmjildoan" target="_blank">**Progress Telerik Test Studio Extension**</a>.

**Test Studio 2017 R2 SP1 (v. 2017.2.824) And Earlier**

The extensions for Test Studio versions as of 2017 R2 SP1 (v. 2017.2.824) and earlier are divided into two separate extensions: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telerik-test-studio-chrom/fiahpmmidlchdfcdpckaclkancbnbgnl" target="_blank">**Progress Test Studio Chrome Recorder**</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telerik-test-studio-chrom/pncoonbpgmlbbjnnmaindchmjckkjcdb" target="_blank">**Progress Test Studio Chrome Execution**</a>.

<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telerik-test-studio-chrom/fhemhbheldeocfphcgnliopkkaapnclg" target="_blank">**Telerik Test Studio Chrome Explore**</a> - the <a href="/features/testing-types/exploratory-testing/overview" target="_blank">exploratory extension</a> is not mandatory.
