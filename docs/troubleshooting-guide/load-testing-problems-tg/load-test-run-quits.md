# Load Test Run Quits


## PROBLEM

Load test execution does not complete successfully. 

## SOLUTION

This behavior may be caused by a 'File name too long' exception. This is because the load test project location file path length exceeds 255 characters. To address this, relocate or rename the load project files and folders to avoid exceeding the 255 character limit.
