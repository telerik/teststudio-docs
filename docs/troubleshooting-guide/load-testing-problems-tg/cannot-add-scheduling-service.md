# Cannot Add Scheduling Service

## PROBLEM

 In the **Manage Virtual Users** dialog, the **Add Scheduling Service** button does not connect to a remote scheduling service.

![Could not connect][1]

## SOLUTION

As of 2013.1.806, the Add Scheduling Service dialog only looks for Scheduling Servers that are listening on port 8009. If your scheduling service is listening on a different port, you will need to change it to 8009 before you can add it to the load test.
