# Error 401 in Results

## PROBLEM

When running a load test, the results include a number of 401 responses.

## SOLUTION

This behavior can occur when you configure your load test to use Windows Authentication credentials. Test Studio opens a new connection each time it executes a user profile, which can result in a large number of 401 responses containing authentication challenges applicable to the requested resource. 

- If one or two 401 responses are followed by a 200-Okay response, this means that authentication was successful. 

- If there are more than two 401 responses with no 200 response, this means that your load test is not providing valid credentials when they are required by the server. 

- If the 401 responses are followed by a 403-Forbidden response, this means that the credentials your load test provided lacked the permissions required for the requested resource.
