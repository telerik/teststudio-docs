## Description

I need to update cached credentials for a TFVC source control repository associated with my Telerik Test Studio project. However, Test Studio doesn't prompt me for updated credentials even after attempting various steps like workspace removal, Credential Manager cleanup, and project disconnection.

This knowledge base article also answers the following questions:
- How to reset TFVC credentials in Telerik Test Studio?
- How to enable credential prompts in Test Studio after changes?
- Where are TFVC credentials stored for Test Studio projects?

## Solution

To refresh cached credentials for a TFVC repository, follow these steps:

1. Locate the settings file in the user folder: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\ArtOfTest`.
2. Open the `PerUserSettings.json` file using a text editor like Notepad++.
3. Find the setting `"TfsSkipAuth"` in the file.
4. Change the value of `"TfsSkipAuth"` from `true` to `false`.
5. Save the changes to the file.
6. Delete the `WebUITestStudio.json` file in the same directory.
7. Start Telerik Test Studio.
8. Attempt to connect to the TFVC repository. Test Studio will prompt for credentials.
