# Find Element Timeout


## Problem

When navigating to a Silverlight application, the navigate step succeeds, but while the Silverlight app is loading, the second step fails. The error log displays an 'Unable to locate element' error for the target element.

## SOLUTION

This issue is caused by the Silverlight plugin not loading before the second step navigates. The solution is to enable the 'Use StepWaitOnElementsTimeout' test step property for the failing step after the navigate, and increase the 'WaitOnElementsTimeout' test step property to allow the plugin to load (for example, to 30000 ms).
