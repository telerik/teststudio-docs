# Unable to Find the Target Host

## PROBLEM

I'm trying to run a Silverlight test from Quick Execution, as part of a test list, or through the Telerik Testing Framework. The test fails with the Unable to find the target host error at the initial stages.

## SOLUTION

This is likely related to the test settings. This errors frequently shows up when you add a coded step that performs actions against Silverlight elements in your test. There are a few things you need to check:

- If you're running the test from Quick Execution in the Standalone version, go to the Project tab and check whether the test's *SilverlightEnabled* <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-properties-standalone" target="_blank">Test Property</a> is set to True.

- If you're running the test as part of a test list (applicable for the Standalone version and VS plugin), check whether the SilverlightEnabled property is set to True on the Web tab of <a href="/getting-started/test-execution/test-list-settings" target="_blank">Test List Settings</a>.

- Increase the Silverlight Connect Timeout in Project Settings > <a href="/features/project-settings/recording-options" target="_blank">Recording Options</a>.

- If running the test as part of a test list, increase the Silverlight Connect Timeout on the Web tab of <a href="/getting-started/test-execution/test-list-settings" target="_blank">Test List Settings</a>..

- If you're using the Telerik Testing Framework, ensure your test includes the code below as the first line of your test. This is seen in <a href="/testing-framework/write-tests-in-code/silverlight-wpf-automation-wtc/silverlight-ui-automation" target="_blank">this example</a>.

	

	Settings.Current.Web.EnableSilverlight = true;

> These solutions apply only for execution-related problems with Silverlight (i.e. you were able to record a test successfully). If you're unable to connect the recorder to your Silverlight application to record a test, see <a href="/troubleshooting-guide/recording-problems-tg/silverlight-unable-connect" target="_blank">this article</a>.
