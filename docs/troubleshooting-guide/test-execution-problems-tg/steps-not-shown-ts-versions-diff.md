# Test Steps Not Showing in Step Panel


## Problem

Steps are not shown in the step panel when opening a test from the project explorer. An empty screen appears instead of the recorded steps.

**Reason: The project is opened with Test Studio version which is older than the one used for creating the tests.** 

## Solution

Update the Test Studio installation to the latest available or least to the one used to create the project.
