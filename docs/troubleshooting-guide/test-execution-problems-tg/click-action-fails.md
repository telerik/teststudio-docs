# Click Action is Offset

## Problem

When executing a test with real user actions, like **SimulateRealClick**, **SimulateRealTyping** or <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/actions/mouse-actions" target="_blank"><strong>desktop click</strong></a>, the click action is offset. As a result the expected button is not triggered, or text is not entered in the input field, and the test fails.

## Solution

1. Ensure <a href="/features/project-settings/browsers" target="_blank">the browser is calibrated</a>. Test Studio tests are meant to always be run with the browser zoom level at 100%.

2. Set the Windows options to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-text-and-apps-bigger-c3095a80-6edd-4779-9282-623c4d721d64" target="_blank">enlarge __text and apps size__</a> to 100%.

3. Set the monitor's **DPI** setting at **Smaller** or **100%** as well.
