# Tests Not Executed in Chrome or Firefox

## Problem

Test Studio <a href="/getting-started/configure-your-browser/Chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a> or <a href="/getting-started/configure-your-browser/Firefox" target="_blank">Firefox</a> browser latest extensions have been installed and browsers properly <a href="/features/project-settings/browsers" target="_blank">calibrated</a>. But it's still not possible to execute/record a test using those browsers and the following exception appears in the <a href="/troubleshooting-guide/troubleshooting-tools-tg/using-the-execution-log" target="_blank">execution log</a>.

````
[Date, Time] - Error attempting to exit runner. Error: System.IO.IOException: Pipe is broken.

## Solution

The exception indicates that the communication between the product and the browser extension has been broken and no further test recording or execution is possible. Such problem is most probably caused by an active firewall or anti-virus software on the testing machine. Try to stop or deactivate that software to resolve the problem.
