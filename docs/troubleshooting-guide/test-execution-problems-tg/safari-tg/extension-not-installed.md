# Safari Extension Not Installed

## PROBLEM

I cannot execute a test in Safari. I receive the following message:

*Safari automation extension has not yet been installed. Please click 'Install' when
prompted to install the WebUI automation extension and close the Safari window
once the extension has been installed.*

![Not installed][1]

## SOLUTION

If things go as expected, clicking OK on the above message should load Safari and display the prompt below. Click **Install** to proceed. Once finished, your test should execute in Safari. 

![Install][2]

If the test does not execute, or you never receive the second prompt, install the Safari extension manually:

1.&nbsp; Locate the following file:

 - **C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Test Studio\Browser Extensions\Safari\WebUI.safariextz**

2.&nbsp; Right click the file and select **Open with**.

![Open With][3]

 

3.&nbsp; Open the file with Safari to install the extension. 

![Safari][4]

4.&nbsp; Retest Safari execution in Test Studio.
