# Wait for Condition Timed Out

## PROBLEM

You may encounter the *Wait for condition* has timed out error after your test performs a click action.

__Failure Information:__

````
Wait for condition has timed out
InnerException:
System.TimeoutException: Wait for condition has timed out
at ArtOfTest.WebAii.Core.Browser.WaitUntilReady()
````

This indicates the test timed out waiting for the browser to return to a "ready" state after the click command was sent to it.

## SOLUTION

This can be often overcome by setting the applicable step's **SimulateRealClick** property to True. Find it under the Behavior heading in the Properties pane.

![SimulaterRealClick][1]

When set to **True**, Test Studio will not wait for the browser to return to a "ready" state. Also, it will not automatically refresh its local copy of the DOM. Instead it sends the click command to the browser (as a live user would) and immediately moves on to the next test step.
