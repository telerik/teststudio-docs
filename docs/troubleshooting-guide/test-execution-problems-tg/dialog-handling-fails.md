# Dialog Handling Fails

## PROBLEM

In multiple browsers, dialog handling fails to enter dialog field text or click dialog buttons accurately.

## SOLUTION

Conflicts with automatic form completion software can cause this behavior in dialog handler execution. Specifically, <a href="http://www.roboform.com/" target="_blank">RoboForm</a> can conflict with Test Studio dialog handling in this manner. Uninstalling RoboForm can resolve this behavior.
