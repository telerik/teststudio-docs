# No file path for IE 10 upload dialog

## PROBLEM

In Internet Explorer 10, recording against a file upload dialog may record a dialog handler step with no file path.

## SOLUTION

In Windows 8, the default folder settings hide known file extensions, which prevents Test Studio file path recording. To fix this behavior, disable the 'Hide extensions for known file types' setting in the Folder Options View tab for the origin folder.
