# Executive Dashboard

The **Executive Dashboard** allows you to monitor the results from <a href="/features/scheduling-test-runs/remote-scheduled-run" target="_blank">remotely executed test lists</a> per project. The **Executive Dashboard** gathers the results from the **Storage Server**, so you can have an overview and generate reports.

![Navigation header][1]

* **Results** - Shows test list results from all remotely executed test lists.
* **Reports** - Generate, analyzed and export reports from test list executions.
* **About** - Details about the version of the Executive Dashboard.

> **Note:** Test lists that are executed locally will not be uploaded to the **Storage Server** automatically. You can publish them to the server, that your project is connected to, from the **Results** tab and **Publish to Server** button.

You can monitor the results and generate reports from remote test list executions in the brower and on all kinds of devices that can access the Executive Dashboard. Please find more details for the **Executive Dashboard** and all of its features below.
