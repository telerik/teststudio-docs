<p class="trigger"><a href="#">Overview of the ticketing system</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
<div class="block">
<p>Once you <a href="http://www.telerik.com/account/support-tickets.aspx" target="_blank">submit a support ticket</a>, the system automatically notifies the Telerik support officers and creates a thread in your support history. Our engineers will then review your ticket and respond within the guaranteed response time. The reply will be appended to your support thread and, for your extra convenience, you will also receive an e-mail with all the information.<br><br>

You do not need to follow up with us, if the provided answer solves your issue. However, we recommend that you do so, as this will help the support officers close the issue faster.<br><br>

In case you need to continue the thread and provide some additional information, you should log into <a href="http://www.telerik.com/account.aspx" target="_blank">Your Account</a>, go to the respective thread and post your reply via the web interface.<br><br>

Note that titles of unread support tickets will show up in bold text, while those of already reviewed replies will not.<br><br>

In order for us to make the ticketing system more effective, we need your cooperation. We kindly ask that you create a new thread for each incident/inquiry of a different nature and for each different product line. In case you open a ticket for one product, but your questions are for another one, we will move the thread under the relevant category, but you may not receive a timely response.</p>

As with any other system, there are some guidelines to follow in order for you to get a quality support experience:<br><br>
		<li>Review the publicly available resources prior to submitting a support ticket. We have various resources (online demos, documentation, knowledge base, code library, videos, forums, etc.) with thousands of examples/threads and there is a good chance that the answer to your inquiry/issue is already there.</li>
		<li>Start a support thread for each different issue that you face. This will make things simpler and also, it will be easier for you to track the progress of all your incidents.</li>
		<li>Do not enter support incidents in "Feature requests".</li>
		<li>Before submitting a "Bug report" entry, please make sure that you have provided us with enough information, so that we can reproduce the problem. The more details you send, the easier it will be for us to isolate the problem and resolve it.</li>
		<li>Please do not use “General feedback” to post your technical problems. The purpose of this section is to allow you to send us feedback on our site, our products, and our services.</li><br><br>
		Note: After we reproduce a bug or add a feature request to our ToDo list, we will add Telerik points to your account and send out a notification.

        <p>Sometimes it is difficult to make a distinction between a support incident and a bug report. However, if you feel that there is a generic problem with any of our products that can be reproduced, you should definitely consider opening a "Bug report".<br><br>

		While submitting a "Bug report" entry, please make sure you give us as many details as possible. As a start, please provide the steps required to reproduce the error, as well as some information about your environment (OS, .NET framework, browser, and so on).<br><br>

		Additionally, if you feel that screenshots or some other visual material will help us understand the issue better, please do not hesitate to attach those to the thread. A runnable project that exhibits the problem would be appreciated as well.</p>

## Test Studio Licensing

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">What license do I get with Test Studio?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>Test Studio is offered with a User License with Subscription and Priority Support which gives a specific machine rights to build, modify and execute tests. Test Studio can be installed on multiple machines as long as it’s only activated on one machine at a time (assuming a single license is purchased). If you need to move the license to another machine, a simple, one-click deactivation will free-up the license so it may be activated on another machine. There is no limit to the number of times this process can be performed and no need to get in touch with us, it just works.<br><br>
		The User License with Subscription and Priority Support offers free updates and priority support for 1 year. </p>
    </div>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">Do I need a license key to install Test Studio and/or Test Studio Run-Time?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>While technically a license key is indeed required, we take care of this for you. When activating your license of Test Studio with our ‘Automatic Activation’ option – you simply enter your Telerik.com credentials and we will auto-create the license key for you.<br><br> 

		Please follow the installation instructions provided in your purchase notification e-mail to successfully activate your license.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">Can I move my license from one machine to another?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>Yes, you can. Test Studio utilizes a per-machine licensing model. This means your license can be activated multiple times on different machines, but not simultaneously. To swap a license between multiple machines - Install Test Studio on each machine, activate one of those instances with your license and use it. When you want to migrate the license to a different machine, deactivate the current instance. Then activate Test Studio on the other machine. <a href="http://www.telerik.com/purchase/teststudio" target="_blank">Read more</a>.</p>

<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>Test Studio features do not require administrative rights to function properly. </p>
        <p>Only certain configuration tasks require to be initiated from Windows Administrator account. Here is a list of these:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>1. <a href="/prerequisites/installation/install-procedure" target="_blank">Test Studio installation</a></strong> – initial install, modification of existing installation, uninstall.</li>

## Installation 

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">I want to just copy the Test Studio DLL's to a new machine instead of running the installer.</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>Setting up Test Studio or the Testing Framework so that it is fully functional requires much more than just copying a few DLL's into the right folder. Browser extensions must be installed, registry settings must be made, some DLL's must be added to the Global Assembly Cache. The only way to get it setup properly is to run the installer. Otherwise something won't work right: test project compiles may fail, the recorder may fail to attach, tests may fail to run in a specific browser, if you're trying to use Microsoft Test Manager you may get strange error messages.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">Can I do an automatic silent install?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>In theory it should be possible. Our installer is a .msi file. You should be able to use <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/314881" target="_blank">Microsoft's MSIEXEC command line tool</a>, with correct command line parameters to do a silent install. DISCLAIMER: we do not officially support this. If you can get it to work then great. If not we're unable to guide you on how to make it work.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">Can I run my test scripts on a remote machine which does not have Test Studio installed?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>No, Test Studio must be installed on the remote machine in order to be able to run tests on it. You must run the installer for the product you intend to use on the remote machine:
		<ul>
		<li>Test Studio Functional</li>
		<li>Test Studio Load.</li>
		<li>Send us the stack trace of the exception you are receiving (if applicable)</li>
		<li>Test Studio Run-Time - this is the most commonly product used on remote machines. It comes with our Scheduler, Storage Service and Execution Server. Everything you need to run Test Studio tests remotely. It is only missing the Test Studio IDE used for opening, creating and editing tests.</li>
		<li>Testing Framework</li>
		</ul></p>
    </div>
</div>

## Activation

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">How do I activate Test Studio?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>There are two ways to activate Test Studio::
		<ul>
		<li><a href="/getting-started/installation/activating-your-license" target="_blank">Automatic Activation</a> - for a computer that has an Internet connection.</li>
		<li><a href="/getting-started/installation/manual-activation" target="_blank">Manual Activation</a> - for a computer that does not have an Internet connection.</li>
		</ul></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">My computer does not have an Internet connection. How do I activate Test Studio on it?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>You can use any computer that has an Internet connection and a web browser and follow our <a href="/getting-started/installation/manual-activation" target="_blank">Manual Activation</a> process to activate Test Studio on your computer that does not have an Internet connection.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">Can I transfer my Test Studio license to another machine?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>Yes. Simply follow the <a href="/knowledge-base/activation-kb/swap-license" target="_blank">Swap License</a> procedure.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">Is there a limit to the number of times I can transfer my Test Studio license?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>No there is no limit. You can transfer your license between machines as many times as you need to.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">When I try to activate Test Studio on my machine it tells me there are no free slots available?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>If you purchased 5 licenses for Test Studio, then you can have up to 5 machines in your organization all activated at the same time. When you try to activate a 6th machine you will get this message. You must deactivate one of your other machines before you can activate the new one.<br><br>
		There are other reasons that can cause no free activation slots to become available, for example your machine crashed while it was activated, or you want to use Test Studio at home but forgot to deactivate it at work. When this happens you can use the <a href="http://www.telerik.com/account/your-products/testing-tools-manage-license-keys.aspx" target="_blank">Manage License Keys Page</a> to delete the errant activation freeing up a slot in the process.</p>

## Test Recording




<p class="trigger"><a href="#">Can I automate CAPTCHA?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>Test Studio cannot be used to automate it. CAPTCHA is specifically designed to ensure the response is generated by a person and not a computer.<br><br>The best we can offer in terms of testing phase for an application is as follows: 
        <ul>
		<li>Whitelist company test IP. Adding your company or test machine’s IP to the trusted list and allow these IP to pass the CAPTCHA.</li>
		<li>Turn off the CAPTCHA on the test environment, for example if you have testing, staging, and production.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

## Source Control

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">What source control systems does Test Studio support?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>Test Studio has built-in support for Git-based repositories. However you can use other source control systems as well. Since all Test Studio projects are file based, you can use any source control system outside of Test Studio that will check files in and out.</p>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">Is there a way I can run my tests in different versions of the same browser on the same machine</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>No. You can only install one version of the browser on a machine at a time. Test Studio will run the test in whatever version is currently installed. There is no mechanism to instruct Test Studio to run the test in a specific browser version such as IE 8.<br><br>
		However you can have multiple different browsers installed on the same machine at the same time. Then Test Studio can run your tests in each of the available browsers, one browser at a time (not concurrently on the same machine).

    </div>
</div>

<p class="trigger"><a href="#">How do I run my tests in different browser versions?</a></p>
<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>To run your tests in multiple versions of the same browser requires you to setup multiple machines. Test Studio can only use the version of the browser that is currently installed on one machine. If you want to do something like run your tests in Chrome v.130, v.131, and v.133 requires you to setup 3 different machines (which can be VM's) each with a different version of Chrome installed on it.</p>

<div class="toggle_container">
   <div class="block">
        <p>This happens when you add the Test Studio automatically generated file Pages.g.cs/vb to your Visual Studio project. This is unnecessary because our Visual Studio plug-in will automatically include this file in all compiles. By adding it to you Visual Studio project file, it creates duplicate compile references, and hence this error. Simply remove the Pages.g.cs/vb file from your Visual Studio project to fix this build error.</p>
