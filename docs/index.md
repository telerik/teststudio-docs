# Overview

<a href="http://www.telerik.com/teststudio" target="_blank">Test Studio</a> is an innovative and easy-to-use automated web, WPF and load testing solution. Test Studio tests support essential technologies like ASP.NET AJAX, Silverlight, PHP and MVC.


<a href="/getting-started/test-recording/overview" target="_blank">Test Studio functional testing</a> is a comprehensive yet cost-effective automated testing suite. Users can complete tasks quickly and easily with the product’s point-and-click interface, which is augmented by Telerik-exclusive features like a visual storyboard and 3D element selection. Test Studio also offers script-less test automation for Silverlight applications.

 

<a href="/features/testing-types/load-testing/overview" target="_blank">Test Studio load tests</a> allow users to capture quickly capture, multiply and replay complex web traffic. Record HTTP traffic from desktop browsers, mobile devices and web services, and replay traffic with hundreds or thousands of virtual users spread across multiple machines. Fine-tune your load scenario with data binding, user authentication, and dynamic targets. 

<a href="/test-studio-mobile/overview" target="_blank">Test Studio Mobile</a> is an intuitive and easy to use test automation solution for Mobile application testing. Create tests once and test across multiple devices and OS’s. The point and click functionality allows users to capture quickly and replay complex mobile testing functionality. There is no need to write a single line of code. Test against any number of real devices as you wish or through an emulator by connecting through Wifi.

<a href="/test-studio-for-apis/overview" target="_blank">Test Studio for APIs</a> helps customers verify the integrity and reliability of their APIs in an easy way and incorporate their API testing effort in their continuous testing and delivery process. Test Studio for APIs is used to determine whether APIs return the correct response for a broad range of commonly accepted requests, react properly to edge cases such as failures and unexpected inputs, as well as deliver the responses in an acceptable amount of time.

**Test Studio** offers two product versions:

-  Test Studio Web & Desktop version performs web and WPF testing and includes the Visual Studio plugin.
-  The Ultimate version combines **Web**, **Mobile**, **WPF**, **Load testing** and **Test Studio for APIs**.

> Test Studio includes runtime files that allow for the execution of tests on the machine in which it’s licensed. Our <a href="/general-information/test-studio-run-time" target="_blank">**Runtime Edition**</a> is available and suggested for build servers and remote machines where test execution is required. 

All versions use identical repositories and file formats, facilitating seamless collaboration between even geographically diverse teams.
