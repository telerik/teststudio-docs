## Who is Test Studio Designed For?

Test Studio is designed to fit your entire team. Test Studio’s visual test recorder is the ideal tool for less experienced QA’s that aim to switch from manual to automated testing. They can start creating automated tests within days without the need to write code. Test Studio’s embedded C# or VB code editor allows more experienced test engineers to go into the tests’ code and create advanced in-code actions. The software engineers on your team on the other hand can take advantage of the built-in Visual Studio extension allowing them to access the same test projects within Visual Studio and collaborate with QA.

## Testing Framework and Flagship Technology

Test Studio is not based on Selenium or other Open Source frameworks but on proprietary technology—the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/teststudio/testing-framework" target="_blank">Telerik Testing Framework</a>. It is a .NET based framework backed by Progress that continuously undergoes updates as to support development of new Test Studio functionality. Thanks to the underlying testing framework, writing C# or VB based automated tests is supported inside Test Studio.

## Supported Testing Methodologies

Making sure your application is free from defects requires a testing strategy that integrates several testing methodologies and combines a variety of tests, each of which proves some aspect of your application is ready for deployment. Test Studio supports all kinds of functional UI testing, covering any web technology—the entire .NET stack for web, including legacy and modern technologies like Blazor, WPF desktop as well as Java Script based front-end technologies like Angular, React and jQuery. Automating frequent and repetitive tests with Test Studio not only supports efficient and cost-effective regression testing, but it also enables you to set up tests for all environments you need to test against.

Test Studio also supports load and performance testing by allowing you to convert functional into load tests or easily <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/designing-load-tests-test-studio-fiddler-6-easy-steps" target="_blank">build load tests from scratch</a>, without code and based on Fiddler Everywhere logs. The <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/api-testing" target="_blank">API testing</a> capabilities in Test Studio let you create verifications against all common RESTful API requests with the possibility to use API tests as steps in automated UI tests. Thanks to Test Studio’s integration capabilities, tests can be scheduled to run as part of any CI/CD setup, in Azure pipelines using <a href="/advanced-topics/build-server/microsoft-hosted-agent-testing" target="_blank">Microsoft-hosted agents</a> or even in <a href="/advanced-topics/build-server/docker-container-testing" target="_blank">Docker containers</a>.
