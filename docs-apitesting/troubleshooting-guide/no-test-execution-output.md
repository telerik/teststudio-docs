# No Test Execution Output

If you run the tests and don't receive test execution output 

![NoTestExecutionOutput][1]

you can follow the steps below to troubleshoot the problem:

- start recording the test step requests with TestStudio for APIs or Fiddler and check whether a request is executed in the first place. 
- execute tests through the <a href="/features/command-line">command line interface</a> directly and check if the result is the same (there are no entries logged in the console).
- finally you need to reinstall the application which will solve the issue.
