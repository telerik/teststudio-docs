#Running Sample Project 

To help you explore the functionalities of Test Studio for APIs we have created a demo test project that calls a very simple demo application under test.

1. Create a demo project

    ![Create demo project](/img/getting-started/sample-project/create-demo-project.png)

2. Run the demo application under test

    ![Run demo application](/img/getting-started/sample-project/run-demo-application.png)

3. Minimize the window of the demo application under test

3. Execute the demo project's tests

We strongly encourage you to deeply review the demo tests and see how our product works.
