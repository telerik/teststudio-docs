# Project Explorer

The Project Explorer pane shows a tree-like structure of your tests in the project. Tests can be added directly to the project, or logically grouped in folders. Double click opens the test. Folders in turn, can be nested forming hierarchical representation of your testing solution.

Drag and drop test cases, folders and code items to **reorder** them. (*Ordering is supported since version R3 2017. Prior versions display and execute tests in alphabetical order.*)

Each project file has a context menu with further actions that can be taken. Note that some context menu items will show up only for certain project file types.

 You are able to create a step, test, folder from the buttons of the toolbar.

 ![Toolbar buttons][5]

 Searching through tests is supported by a search field at the top right corner of the pane. The search text is dynamic and once typing starts, items will be filtered with every key stroke.

 ![Search][6]
 
 The Top right corner of the Project explorer pane is reserved for visibility controlling buttons. The pane can be docked, pinned or closed. In addition it can be moved by drag-drop of its header or resized by drag-drop of its borders.
 
 If the Project explorer pane is accidentally closed or in case a layout reset is needed, the View menu >> Reset Layout can be used.


## Disable Test Cases and Steps

Test cases and individual steps can be disabled. This way they remain part of the project, but will not be executed during test execution.

 ![Disable Step][7]


You can still execute a disabled test case or step if you explicitly select it and click on "Run Test" / "Run Step".
