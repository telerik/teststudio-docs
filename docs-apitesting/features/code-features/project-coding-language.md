# Project Coding Language

The first time a [coded step](./coded-steps), a [code-behind file](./code-behind-files) or a [standalone code item](./code-items) is added to a project, you will be prompted to select a coding language for the project.

You can choose between **C#** and **Visual Basic**.

Once selected, the coding language is set for the whole test project and that project can manage and execute only this type of code files. Once selected, the coding language cannot be changed for a particular project.
