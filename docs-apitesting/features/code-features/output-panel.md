# Output Panel

The Output panel displays a record of log messages recorded by Test Studio® for APIs throughout runtime. These include build errors that occur when a project is compiled.

Its default location is in the middle bottom pane.

You could chose between **General** and **Compile** option to filter the type of information in the panel.

In the **General** output you will see information about the test execution status, verification and log messages.
