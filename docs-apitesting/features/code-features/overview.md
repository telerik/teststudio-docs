# Code Features Overview

Progress® Test Studio® for APIs allows you to write C# or Visual Basic code and have it executed using [coded steps](./coded-steps) as part of the test execution. Code files can either be associated as [code-behind](./code-behind-files) to test cases or be added to the project as [standalone code items](./code-items).

[Coded steps](./coded-steps) can be useful for handling complex scenarios that cannot be achieved using the built-in functionality of the Test Studio® for APIs UI. Use [Coded steps](./coded-steps) in cases involving data manipulation, calculations, access to environment data (like getting the current date and time), complex conditional logic or any other scenario that you find useful.

[Standalone code items](./code-items) enable you to create reusable libraries of code for better maintainability of your projects.
