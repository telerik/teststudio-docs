# Debug Project

When a test project is compiled, Progress速 Test Studio速 for APIs generates a **.pdb** file along with the compiled **.dll** in order to allow you to debug your project.

To launch the debugger in Visual studio, you can add a `Debugger.Launch()` statement in the code that you wish to debug. (You wll need a `using System.Diagnostics` statement too.)

```C#
`Debugger.Launch();
```

```VB
`Debugger.Launch()`
```

![Add Debug Statement][1]

Once you have added your `Debugger.Launch()` statement, run your test project. You will be prompted to approve the degugger launch. Click on *"Yes, debug Telerik.ApiTesting.Runner.exe"*.

![Accept Debug Prompt][2]

Next, select a Visual Studio instance.

![Select VS Instance][3]

Finally, your code will be loaded in Visual Studio with the debugger, stooped at the `Debugger.Launch()` statement. You can keep debugging your project from that point on as an ordinary Visual Studio projet.
