# Getting Started: Automation Testing with Test Studio Dev

__Test Studio Dev Edition__ is the Test Studio plugin for Visual Studio.With this plugin you can create UI functional tests for web, WPF and desktop applications and execute these, get detailed results from the test runs and maintain the test scenarios. 

Follow the steps lised below to get familiar with the Test Studio Dev Edition capabilities.

## Create a Test Studio Dev Project

Create a new project using the Test Studio Dev template - select _Create New Test Project_ under the _Telerik->Test Studio_ menu.

<table id=no-table>
	<tr>
		<td>![Create TS Dev project](images/quickstart/create-project.png)<br><br>**Visual Studio 2017**</td>
		<td>![Create TS Dev project VS 2019](images/quickstart/create-project-vs-2019.png)<br><br>**Visual Studio 2019**</td>
	</tr>
<table>

Next choose the type of programming language between _C# or VB.NET_ and set a meaningful name for your first project.

<table id=no-table>
	<tr>
		<td>![Choose type of TS Dev project](images/quickstart/name-of-project.png)<br><br>**Visual Studio 2017**</td>
		<td>![Choose type of TS Dev project VS 2019](images/quickstart/name-of-project-vs-2019.png)<br><br>**Visual Studio 2019**</td>
	</tr>
<table>

### Add a Test in Project

By default the newly created project contains a Web test.

![Web Test Included By Default](images/quickstart/web-test-by-default.png)

To add new test in the project click with the right mouse button on the project name in Solution Explorer, select _Add_ and choose between _Test Studio Web Test..._ or _Test Studio WPF Test..._.

![Add New Test](images/quickstart/add-new-test.png)

The respective item is selected in the list of items, type a name and click _Add_.

![Name New Test](images/quickstart/add-new-test-wizard.png)

To open the test double click on its name in the Solution Explorer.

![Open new test](images/quickstart/open-new-test.png)

## Record a Test

>__Note!__ The supported for __recording browsers__ are __Internet Explorer__, __Chrome__, __FireFox__ and __Edge Chromium__.

Double click a test from the Solution Explorer to open it. Click on any of the _Record_ buttons to launch a new browser or an instance of the WPF application to record against.

![Click Record Button](images/quickstart/record-button.png)

Once the browser/application is launched the <a href="/features/recorder/recording-toolbar" target="_blank">Test Studio Dev recorder toolbar</a> gets attached to the that instance and records steps in the test for each action against the application under test.

## Elements Explorer

The <a href="/features/elements-explorer/overview" target="_blank">Elements Explorer</a> displays all elements included in the test during recording the test. It is similar to the DOM Explorer in that it displays a tree of elements, but the Elements Explorer only contains elements you want to use in your tests. Also, the elements in the tree view have properties that are more specific to testing.

To open the Elements Explorer in project click on the _Show Elements Explorer_ button. It will appear in the lower middle pane next to _Error List_ and _Output_ tabs.

![Show Elements Explorer](images/quickstart/elements-explorer.png)

The Elements Explorer can be also shown on screen from the Telerik menu.

## Execute a Test

>__Note!__ The supported browsers for execution are __Internet Explorer, Chrome, FireFox, Microsoft Edge, Safari__.

Test Studio Dev tests could be executed from the _VS Test Explorer_ or with the _Test Studio Dev Test Runner_.

### Test Studio Dev Quick Execution

To execute the currently opened test click on the _Execute Test_ button to select a browser to run the test against.

![Quick Execute Test](images/quickstart/execute-test-button.png)

An instance of the selected browser will start and all recorded actions in test will be executed.

Read more details for the <a href="/features/test-execution/quick-execution" target="_blank">settings</a> which could be applied for the test run.

### VS Test Explorer Execution

The Test Explorer in Visual Studio automatically lists and provides all __Test Studio Dev__ tests for execution. 

![VS Test Explorer](images/quickstart/vs-test-expl.png)

Ensure the __project is re-built before initiating a run from the VS Test Explorer__. Any recent changes will not be reflected otherwise.

Run the tests with the _Run All_ button. Or choose a group of tests to run from the dropdown options of the _Run..._ button in Test Explorer.

![VS Test Explorer Run Tests](images/quickstart/vs-test-expl-run-tests.png)

An instance of the selected browser will start and all recorded actions in test will be executed.

Find further details for the <a href="/features/test-execution/vs-test-explorer" target="_blank">Test Explorer execution</a>.

## Test Results

Each test run generates test results.

### View Results

__Test Studio Dev Quick Execution__ displays the outcome of the executed test in overall and writes verbose results info in an <a href="/features/failed-tests-debugging/using-the-execution-log" target="_blank">_Execution log_</a>. The test results are available for review as long as the test stays opened in the solution or until the _Clear results_ button is clicked.

![Quick Execute Test Results](images/quickstart/quick-execution-overall-results.png)

The _Execution log_ provides details for the executed steps in the test.

![Quick Execute Test Execution Log](images/quickstart/quick-execution-log.png)

__VS Test Explorer__ displays the results of test execution under the list of test in Test Explorer pane. These are in the same format as the results generated by Test Studio Dev execution. The test results are available until the project/solution stays opened.

![VS Test Explorer Results](images/quickstart/vs-test-expl-results.png)

### Debugging Failed Test Results

The test execution will be terminated in case a step fails and the test will be marked as _Failed_.

__Test Studio Dev__ displays status for each step in the test - _Passed, Failed, Not Run_. Hovering over the red crossed circle in front the failed step will show a tooltip with details about the failure.

![Failed Step Tooltip](images/quickstart/failed-step.png)

Click on the red crossed circle opens the <a href="/features/failed-tests-debugging/step-failure-details" target="_blank">__Step Failure Details__</a> dialog. It provides detailed description of the failure reason and additional debugging options.

![Failed Step Details](images/quickstart/failed-step-details.png)

__VS Test Explorer__ displays the test as well as _Failed_. The test result is under the listed tests and displays the common information for the failure as it is listed in the Execution log.

## Coded Steps

__Test Studio Dev Edition__ allows you to implement coded solutions for scenarios that require more complexity than what can be composed with recording your actions or building advanced steps with the Step Builder. You can create new or convert existing steps to coded ones, define your custom logic in code behind files or any custom library that your projects links to.
