# Swap a Test Studio Dev License between machines

_Test Studio Dev_ utilizes a per-machine licensing model. This means your license can be activated multiple times on different machines, but not simultaneously. The license could be deactivated from the <a href="/features/project-settings/updates" target="_blank">__Updates__</a> tab in the project settings.

To **swap** a license between multiple machines perform the following actions:

1.Install Test Studio Dev on each machine.

2.Activate one of those instances with your license and use it.

3.When you want to migrate the license to a different machine, deactivate the current instance.

4.Then activate Test Studio Dev on the other machine.
