# Test Studio Plugin for Jenkins CI

The Test Studio Plugin allows you to build and execute Test Studio tests and test lists in Jenkins CI environment and easily explore the generated JUnit xml results in the built-in Jenkins functionality.

>The Test Studio Plugin supports Test Studio projects only.

1.Install the Jenkins CI server to run as a Java application (instead of running it as a Windows service).

2.Install the Test Studio Plugin - download it <a href="/downloads/Jenkins_Plugin_TeststudioDev.zip" target="_blank">here</a> and add it to the Plugin folder of the Jenkins server installation or download it from the jenkins plugin marketplace.

3.Create a freestyle project. Create an item and select 'Build a freestyle project'.

The *project root folder* and *settings file* fields accept relative path to the Jenkins job workspace only.
