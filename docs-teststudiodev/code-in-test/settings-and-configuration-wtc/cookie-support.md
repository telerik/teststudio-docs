# Cookie Support

Using the CookieManager class you can:

* Retrieve cookies for a particular website from the browser

* Set the contents of a cookie in the browser

* Create a new cookie in the browser

* Delete a cookie in the browser

## Retrieving Cookies

There are two functions that can be used to retrieve cookies from the browser:


````C#
public CookieCollection GetCookies (string url)
public CookieCollection GetCookies (Uri uri)
````
````VB
Public Function GetCookies(ByVal url As String) As System.Net.CookieCollection
Public Function GetCookies(ByVal uri As System.Uri) As System.Net.CookieCollection
````

These functions retrieve all the cookies from the browser for the specified website. For example:

````C#
// Query the cookie
System.Net.CookieCollection siteCookies = ActiveBrowser.Cookies.GetCookies("http://www.telerik.com");
````
````VB
' Query the cookie
Dim siteCookies As System.Net.CookieCollection = ActiveBrowser.Cookies.GetCookies("http://www.telerik.com")
````

## Creating and Setting Cookies

Below is an example of how to create or set a cookie. If the cookie already exists, it will be overwritten. If it does not exist, a new cookie will be created in the browser:

````C#
// Let's create a new cookie for a url.
ActiveBrowser.Cookies.SetCookie(new System.Net.Cookie("WebAii", "Rocks", "/", "http://www.telerik.com"));
````
````VB
' Let's create a new cookie for a url.
ActiveBrowser.Cookies.SetCookie(New System.Net.Cookie("WebAii", "Rocks", "/", "http://www.telerik.com"))
````

## Deleting Cookies

Here is an example of how to delete a cookie:

````C#
// Now delete the cookie.
ActiveBrowser.Cookies.DeleteCookie(siteCookies[0]);
````
````VB
' Now delete the cookie.
ActiveBrowser.Cookies.DeleteCookie(siteCookies(0))
````

A simple foreach loop can be used to delete all the cookies for a particular website:

````C#
// Purge any cookies associated with this server
System.Net.CookieCollection cookies = ActiveBrowser.Cookies.GetCookies(Settings.Current.BaseUrl);
foreach (System.Net.Cookie cookie in cookies)
{
    ActiveBrowser.Cookies.DeleteCookie(cookie);
}
````
````VB
' Purge any cookies associated with this server
Dim cookies As System.Net.CookieCollection = ActiveBrowser.Cookies.GetCookies(Settings.Current.BaseUrl)
For Each cookie As System.Net.Cookie In cookies
     ActiveBrowser.Cookies.DeleteCookie(cookie)
Next cookie
