# How to Invoke an Application

I want to invoke a desktop application (i.e. an .exe file) from a test step.

## Solution

You can write your own code in a <a href="/code-in-test/features-in-code#Coded-Step" target="_blank">coded step</a> that triggers the application you need. Here's a simple example taken from <a href="http://www.csharp-station.com/HowTo/ProcessStart.aspx" target="_blank">this article</a>:

````C#
    System.Diagnostics.Process notePad = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
    notePad.StartInfo.FileName   = "notepad.exe";
    notePad.StartInfo.Arguments = @"c:\myText.txt";
    notePad.Start();
````
````VB
    Dim notePad As New System.Diagnostics.Process()
    notePad.StartInfo.FileName = "notepad.exe"
    notePad.StartInfo.Arguments = "c:\myText.txt"
    notePad.Start()
````

* In the above sample, **C:\myText.txt** is the argument fed to **notepad.exe**. If you want to test this sample code, you'll need to create this file on your local disk first. Otherwise, the notepad application will throw a *file can't be found* error.

* You can also run batch files from a coded step in the same manner.
