# Logon Dialogs

With Logon dialogs, you need to pass in the username/password that you want used and how the dialog should be handled. Your options for the Logon dialog are: DialogButton.OK, DialogButton.CANCEL or DialogButton.CLOSE.

````C#
// Add a logon dialog support with username/password
Manager.DialogMonitor.AddDialog(new LogonDialog(ActiveBrowser, "<username>", "<password>", DialogButton.OK));
Manager.DialogMonitor.Start();

// Navigate to a page that need a logon
ActiveBrowser.NavigateTo("<Place a Url to LogOn to here>");

// Dialog should be automatically handled
