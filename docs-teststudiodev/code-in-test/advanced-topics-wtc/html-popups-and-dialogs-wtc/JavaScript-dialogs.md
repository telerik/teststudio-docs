# Handling Alert Dialogs

With Alerts, you only need to define how the alert should be handled. Your options for alert handling are: DialogButton.OK or DialogButton.CLOSE.

````C#
// Add an alert dialog to monitor
Manager.DialogMonitor.AddDialog(new AlertDialog(ActiveBrowser, DialogButton.OK));

// Given that there were not dialog attribute set, the manager will not start the monitoring.
// You need to invoke the monitoring
Manager.DialogMonitor.Start();

// Invoke an alert dialog
Actions.InvokeScript("InvokeAlert()");

// The dialog will now be automatically handled transparently in the background without any help from the test code.
````

 ```VB
' Add an alert dialog to monitor
Manager.DialogMonitor.AddDialog(New AlertDialog(ActiveBrowser, DialogButton.OK))

' Given that there were not dialog attribute set, the manager will not start the monitoring.
' You need to invoke the monitoring
Manager.DialogMonitor.Start()

' Invoke an alert dialog
Actions.InvokeScript("InvokeAlert()")

' The dialog will now be automatically handled transparently in the background without any help from the test code.
