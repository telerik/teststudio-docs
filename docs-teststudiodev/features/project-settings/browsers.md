# Browsers Tab In Project Settings

Under the Browser Tab, you can set your preferred browser and calibrate your browsers. 

![Browsers][1]

## Preferred Browser

Select an installed browser from the Preferred Browser dropdown to set that browser as the default test recording and Quick Execution browser.

![Preferred Browser][2]

## Calibrate Browser

The Calibrate Browser section automates the configuration of supported browsers for use with Test Studio. Click **Calibrate** next to a browser to update that browser's settings.

![Calibrate][3]

Confirm that any open instances of this browser will be closed.

![Confirm][4]

To restore the original browser settings that were in place before calibration, click **Restore**.

![Restore][5]

> If your Chrome browser has an active Google Apps session (for example, you are logged into GMail), automatic calibration will not work as expected. To use automatic configuration, log out of your Google account first.
