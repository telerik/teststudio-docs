# Translators Tab in Project Settings

<a href="/features/recorder/translators" target="_blank">Translators</a> are extensions that open up an element to work with Test Studio, to allow interaction with the Elements Menu, and to expose a rich set of verification tasks. The product ships with basic translators for HTML, Silverlight, and WPF, and translators built specifically for Telerik AJAX and Silverlight RadControls, KendoUI for jQuery and KendoUI for Angular.

Test Studio Dev was built with extensibility in mind, so as additional controls become available, new translators can be plugged in. Telerik is committed to maintaining translators in step with Telerik controls changes, so you can expect the translators to always be up-to-date.

The Translators section in Project settings allow you to disable or enable translators.
