# Test Lists in Visual Studio 2017 and 2019

As of **Test Studio 2019 R3 (v.2019.3) release** test lists can be also created and executed in a Visual Studio project. There are two types of Test Lists - **Static** and **Dynamic**.

* A <a href="#add-test-files-to-static-test-list">Static Test List</a> contains a fixed, predetermined list of tests.
* A <a href="#add-test-files-to-dynamic-test-list">Dynamic Test List</a> contains a list of tests that is dynamically generated upon execution based on <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-properties-vs" target="_blank">test properties</a>.

> __Note!__ Test lists in Visual Studio can only execute web or WPF functional tests.

## Create a Test List File in Visual Studio

A test list file has the extension ___*.aiilist___ and can be added in a Visual Studio project under a predefined folder named ___TestLists___ - this folder exists in each new project.

![TestLists folder in Solution explorer][1]

Right click on the ___TestLists___ folder and choose __Test Studio Test List__ or __Test Studio Dynamic Test List__ from the _Add_ section sub-menu.

![Add a test list file][2]

Choose a meaningful name for the test list and ensure the correct item from the item list is selected. Confirm the test list creation with the _Add_ button.

![Name and create the test list file][3]

The test list file will be listed under the ___TestLists___ folder.

![Test list file listed under TestLists folder][4]

Build the solution (press F6) and all test list files will appear in the Test Explorer available for execution.

### Add a Test List in Newly Created Project

Ensure you are using Test Studio with minimum version 2019.3 and create a new Test Studio project in Visual Studio 2017 or 2019. In the Solution Explorer you can add test list files under the folder named ___TestLists___.

### Add a Test List in an Existing Project

Once you upgrade Test Studio to minimum version 2019.3 and open an existing project, you will be prompted with a message, that the project needs to be upgraded as well. Once the upgrade is done and the project is loaded, you will need to include the ___TestLists___ folder in the solution.

<br>

To do that select the Test Studio project in the __Solution Explorer__ and click the ___Show All Files___ button.

![Show All Files for the TS project][6]

Now all files from the project root folder will be listed in the __Solution Explorer__. Right click the ___TestLists___ folder and select ___Include In Project___.

![Include TestLists folder in TS project][7]

Again click the ___Show All Files___ button to hide the other files. Save and reopen the solution to apply the changes. Now the ___TestLists___ folder can be used to add test list files in it.

## Add Test Files to Static Test List

Once a test list file is added into the ___TestLists___ folder, double click it to choose the test files to add in it.

![Add test to static list][8]

Save the test list file to apply the changes and execute the test list from the ___Test Explorer___ in Visual Studio.

## Add Test Files to Dynamic Test List

Once a test list file is added into the ___TestLists___ folder, double click it to craft the rules to filter, upon specific criteria, the test files to add.

![Add test to dynamic list][9]

The rules can be built upon the specific <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-properties-vs#test-properties-related-to-test-studio-dev" target="_blank">test properties</a>..

![Available properties to create rules][10]

> __Note!__ Each time you run a dynamic test list, the project is being queried and only the tests, which meet the criteria of the rules, are executed.

To change any of the <a href="/features/test-execution/test-list-settings" target="_blank">Test List settings</a> in Visual Studio, use the gear icon in the upper right corner in each test list.

![Test List Settings][11]

## Execute Test List Files in Visual Studio

To execute the designed test lists in Visual Studio, you can use the different <a href="/features/test-execution/vs-test-explorer#run-tests-and-test-lists-in-test-explorer" target="_blank">Run options in Visual Studio Test Explorer</a>.
