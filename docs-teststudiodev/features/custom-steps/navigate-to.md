The _Navigate To_ step is usually the first recorded step in a test. You could insert a Navigate To step at any point of the test where this is required. The URL could be divided into BaseURL and NavigateURL depending on the URL's specifics and optionally the <a href="/features/project-settings/recording-options" target="_blank">recording settings</a> you have applied for adding a page node to the element's repository.
